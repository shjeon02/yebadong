Hi Incheol, <br><br>

I'm so sorry that it took such a long time to get our answers. We have had very 
bad contacts in the band lately. I appreciated your reminding e-mails. 
Thanks a lot for your understanding.<br>

Anyway - Here's the Answers:

<hr>
<b>Question #1 (by Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr)
Your music is surely the best tune that I've ever heard in '90s !
>From the last two albums, you used only classical '70s prog instruments
like mellotron, acoustic piano, flute, electric guitar without much
effect, etc. I think your music's atmosphere would be quite different
if you used some modern instruments. Is there any special reason for you
to choose such a 'classical instrumets' ? Or did you use those instruments
somewhat intentionally to create those 'good old days' feel ?<p>

&bull;Answer #1 <br>
We try to create a sound which is similar to the sound of an symphony
orchestra. That's why we try to use a lot of acoustic instruments and try to
avoid to much effect-processing. We also use old instruments as the mellotron
because it feels alive. You can't use mellotron to simulate real strings or
choirs, but you can use it to make the total sound more alive. The sound of a
symphony orchestra is of course very much alive because each melody has a
dedicated musician. But we never used old instruments to make it sound like a
production from the '70s. <p>

Question #2 (by Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr)
After hearing the new album 'Epilog', I noticed the music is quite different
from 'Hybris'. Sometimes songs from 'Epilog' reminds me of modern classical
music, or even some chamber rock tunes. I was really happy that you did not
create 'Hybris II'. How do you think about the difference between the
two albums ? <p>

&bull;Answer #2 <br>
When we made Epilog none of us was listening to progressive rock anymore. So we
think that we were making more music and less progressive rock this time.
Hybris is (compared to Epilog) more based on prog cliches. <p>

Question #3 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr)
Since we Korean fans could not see you play live, we're somewhat curious
about the guitar playing shared by you(Jonas) and Tod. Who does play the
'lead tunes' generally ? Especially, who have done the cool solo in
Jordrok ?<p>

&bull; Answer #3 <br>
Jonas is playing the lead tunes (and plays the solo in Jordr璵. Jonas has 
very often a sharper sound (from a Fender Strat or Les Paul) while Tord has got
a more "jazzy" sound. Tord is playing most of the acoustic guitars. On Epilog he
didn't play much electric guitar at all.<p>

Question #4 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr)
The cover artwork of 'Epilog' is very interesting. The scene of a pond 
overlapped with human face, right ? Where did you get the picture of
a pond ? Also I'd like to know the meaning of the cover, if exists.<p>

&bull;Answer #4<br>
There is no deap meaning with the cover. It's just beautiful and fits the music
(We hope). It's made by an old swedish artist (an 80-years-old lady, actually)
called Rut Hillarp. <p>

Question #5 (Minsu Jang. cats@super5.hyundai.co.kr)
I think your music is very reminiscent of those '70s big names
like King Crimson and Genesis.
What is your philosophy on songwriting ?
Do you want to succeed to the grand tradition of King Crimson,
Yes and Genesis without putting in newer '90s elements not that much ?
Or do you want make quite different music from your '70s ancestors ?<p>

We definitely want to create something new. We also try not to get to much
influences by those groups you mentioned. We're not very interested in styles.

Question #6 (Minsu Jang, cats@super5.hynudai.co.kr)
We know that there are many great prog groups in Sweden.
How do you think about 70's ancestor prog groups in Sweden ?
What are your favourite Swedish artists ?<p>

They use to be quite good but unfortunately it's seldom that you hear something
that's really new. About the favourite group... some in the band says "Den
Fule" a swedish folk-jazz-band.<p>

Question #7 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr)
This question may partially overlaps with the above one.
We've heard that you're friends with members of Anekdoten.
How do you think about Anekdoten ? and how about the yet another
Scandinavian new group Landberk ? <p>

Yes, we're friends with Anekdoten and Landberk. Anekdoten are incredible live,
but their music isn't as dynamic as their ancestors King Crimson. Landberk
is...nice but more like pop. Those two groups are still much better than the
average prog from USA.<p>

Question #8 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr)
I've listened to the live tapes of Progfest. You played very well
in the gigs, too ! By the way, what is your frank opinion about the other
groups (Echolyn, Sebastian Hardie, Halloween, etc )
attended Progfest '94 together ? 
Also, how do you think about the currently active various prog
sub-genres ? I mean British neo prog typified by IQ and Marillion
, kinda RIO music by American band 5UU's and Japanese bands
Tipographica, Il Berlione etc. and American 'accessible' prog 
exemplified by Kalaban, Animator, Echolyn or even Dream Theater.

Question #9 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr)
I'd like to ask you some non-music related questions.
The pictures of you once appeared in the Korean prog rock magazine
ArtRock (along with stellar praising review of 'Hybris').
The members of your band look very young. Would you please tell
me the birth year of your members ? (My apologies for the wrong spelling
of you and Johan's name, some of the characters are unavailable :-))

Question #11 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr)
Though I saw your post on a.m.p. on the rumour about disbanding,
I'm still curious about your future plan. 
Some guys said 'Epilog' might be a real epilog for the Anglagard
fans, is that true ? Does the album title 'Epilog' have 
that kind of meaning ? 
Is there any plan to rehearse a new album or world wide tour ?

When we made Epilog we felt that this would be the last prog-rock album. The
next one should be something different. That was one meaning of Epilog. Now it
seems like we've disbanded (so, no more gigs). <p>

And finally,
How much cost do you expect for you to come here to play some gigs ?
