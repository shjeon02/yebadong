The current echolyn line-up consists of: 
<ul> <li>Christopher Buzby - keyboards, backing vocals
<li>Tom Hyatt - bass, midi pedals
<li>Brett Kull - guitars, lead and backing vocals
<li>Paul Ramsey - drums and percussion
<li>Ray Weston - lead and backing vocals </ul>
<hr>

&bull;
A.1: Brett Kull, Paul Ramsey, Ray Weston and a different
keyboard player were all in a cover/original band for 4 years
called Narcissus. That band broke up in 1988. In the fall of
1989 Brett, Paul and our old bass player (Jesse Reyes) were
jamming together. They auditioned keyboard players and found me
(Chris Buzby). We called Ray and he re-joined and echolyn was
formed. The only member change weve had is when Jesse Reyes
(bass) quit for personal reasons in May of 1991. We were
fortunate enough to acquire Tom Hyatt almost immediately, and
we have been a strong unit ever since. <p>

A.2: Brett actually came up with the name echolyn. It really
doesnt mean anything at all- it was just a name we all liked.
To us, the name echolyn represents our music and our lyrics. We
pronounce it eh-co-lin. <p>

A.3: We were very frustrated during the writing and
recording of 'Suffocating the Bloom'. People were really
slagging us for the type of music we played, and no one really
seemed to understand the fact that we were very honest about
it. Lyrically Brett and Ray captured a certain theme based on
the suffocated artist and youthful innocence in general.
Musically we tried to capture those same feelings through many
different styles using consonance, dissonance, melody, harmony,
unique song arrangements, 2 and 3-part harmonies, acoustic and
electric instrumentation and musical themes and variations that
would interplay with the lyrics. <p>

A.4: The Suite for the Everyman was a piece that we
didnt set out to make long, it just kind of turned out that
way. For us a musical thought or expression should take as much
or as little time as possible to state itself. Length should
have little to with the quality of a piece of music. On As the
World, instead of writing a long piece with many sections we
decided to write a longer piece that tied itself together
lyrically, but musically each piece stands on its own as a
complete piece of music. The piece on As the World is called
LETTERS. Lyrically it deals with ones progression through life
as a naive child to a dying elderly person. It turned out
really well, and were very happy with it. Cant wait for you
to hear it! <p>

A.5: It would be absolutely impossible to name one main
influence for this band because each member listens to such a
diverse amount of music. Styles range from jazz, classical
(traditional and 20th century), rock, heavy metal, pop, folk,
fusion, blues, new age, etc., etc., etc. Some members did
indeed grow up listening to bands like early Genesis, Yes,
Gentle Giant and Kansas. We feel that what we are doing
musically has so much more to offer than what most bands today
are doing musically. We are simply trying to push the limits of
what music has to offer while creating something fresh and new
each time. Hopefully we will have success at what we love to
do. A few personal musical favorites of each band member are: 
<ul>
<li>Ray Weston- Thin Lizzy; Pantera; Corrosion of Conformity. <li>Tom 
Hyatt- John Paul Jones; Jaco Pastorius; Joni Mitchell.<li>Paul 
Ramsey- Dennis Chambers; Gary Husband; Buddy Rich. <li>Brett Kull-
Anthony Phillips; Pat Metheny; The Beatles. <li>Chris Buzby- Igor
Stravinsky; Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays; Seal.</ul><p>

A.6: On Suffocating the Bloom we actually doubled all the
lead and backing vocals which gave the album a natural chorused
effect on all the vocal parts. On this album there is a similar
doubling and tripling on all the backing vocals, but all the
leads are single (aside from effects that may have been added
during the mixing process). In terms of harmony there is a
whole lot of 2-part and especially 3-part harmony on As the
World. Again, we wanted to take another step forward in
pushing the limits of standard rock music as we know it today.<p>

A.7: We honestly have yet to hear anything else current 
that we really respect or like coming from any American or
European bands playing this type of progressive music. Some of
the guys in the band do like a band named Discipline from the
state of Michigan, USA, and I personally think the members of
Dream Theater are great players, but I dont really like their
compositional style or vocals. In a sense we really seem to
think at times that we are the only band really trying to do
something new, fresh and different- many of the bands you name
(Kalaban; Animator; Magellan) borrow their styles very
blatantly from bands who have already established themselves
(i.e. Marillion, Yes, ELP, etc.). <p>

A.8: We pride ourselves in being able to play everything we
write at a live show. If we ever put something on an album that
we dont want to play live we still have a reason for that
piece of music existing where it does on the album. Even all
the string and woodwind arrangements I do are pulled off live
because I write the original parts in a band sense on my
synthesizers. When we do go into the recording studio I use
real instrumentalists to do all the parts because nothing comes
close to the real thing in classical music- not even great
samplers; although they do serve an important purpose for live
performance. <p>

A.9: SONY Corp./Epic did buy our master tapes to the three
previous releases (echolyn; Suffocating the Bloom; ...and
every blossom) and they will probably be releasing them in the
future. Unfortunately we have no control over the timing of
that decision, as we will have to spend most of our current
time promoting this new album.<p>

    I hope I was able to answer all your questions Incheol. We
are truly excited that there are so many people in Korea, and
all around the world, who listen to our music and like what we
are doing. We hope to make it to Europe, Japan and Korea on a
tour in the not-too-distant future. If we are coming you will
be one of the first to know. If there is anything more we can
do for you please let us know.
