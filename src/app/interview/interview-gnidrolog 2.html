[Goldring] 
  A1. Gnidrolog's music was not intended for commercial purposes. 
    Like many bands we were trying to explore improvisation using 
    modern techniques through songs and instrumental strategies. 
    Although we were signed to RCA which was a big company, they 
    were also interested in progressive music and our work has to 
    be placed in the context of the progressive genre at the time 
    being explored by bands like Soft Machine, King Crimson and Yes. 
    Colin [ my brother] appears on 'The Yes Album' playing recorders 
    on the track ' Your Move.'  The intention of the band was to 
    entertain musically and to break down the barriers by widening 
    our listeners' appreciation of more challenging and demanding 
    music. We were also highly influenced by music from the West Coast 
    of America by bands like Frank Zappa, Spirit, Bob Dylan and Grateful 
    Dead. I have it on good authority that we were highly influential 
    to many of the progressive bands at the time including Gentle Giant 
    and Sparks.

[Goldring] 
  A2. I am glad you like 'I could Never Be a Soldier.' It is 
    a particular favourite of ours - especially the excellent use of 
    recorders and flutes together. The song reflects the considerable 
    concern at the time for the terrible war in Vietnam and the west's 
    involvement leading to the tragic loss of life suffered by young 
    people on both sides.

[Goldring]
  A3. The concept of 'Lady Lake' came from a poem I wrote and the cover 
    design by the bass player, Peter Mars Cowling. If you listen to the 
    words of the song you will find out that it deals with loneliness and 
    alienation. The words are influenced by Lady Guinevere who was the 
    lady of the lake in King Arthur's court. I hoped that the words painted 
    a picture of the coldness and loneliness of the lake and compared it 
    with the loss of loved ones. Like all poems, the sound of the words 
    and poetry are intended to be  as important as the emotions they express.

    'Gnidrolog' is a sort of anagram of our family name - Goldring. 
    The letters are jumbled and confused - like the music.

[Goldring]
  A4. In Spite of Harry's Toe Nail is an excellent album especially the 
    first track - Long Live Man Dead. The master tapes are owned by RCA 
    Victor and I understand it is a very collectable album. Please contact 
    the record company for further information about where the master is.

    A5.  After Gnidrolog split up, band members went on to play and perform 
    with other groups.
    Nigel Pegrum [ drums] joined Steeleye Span and remained their drummer 
    for many years. He owned a record company and Colin and I recorded a 
    lot of commercial work for other record companies as session musicians. 
    He moved to Australia in 1993 and now owns and runs a very successful 
    recording company their. We have kept in contact and remain great 
    friends. He visits England from time to time and we discuss music 
    and have fun talking about the old days.

    Mars Cowling [bass] joined the Pat Travers Band in Canada but I 
    lost touch with him several years ago.
    John Earle joined Graham Parker and The Rumour and went to have 
    a long and successful career as a session musician.

    Colin and me went on to work with Leiber and Stoller who wrote for 
    Elvis Presley and had a lot of success in the punk era with The 
    Pork Dukes, The Street Kings and other bands. You may be surprised 
    to know that we are still playing for fun in our own band, 
    The Goldring Brothers playing rock and roll at colleges and dance 
    venues! Colin is a Psychiatrist and I became a music teacher, 
    teaching improvisation and theory initially at the Blackheath 
    Conservatoire of Music and I am currently a Manager in a Further 
    Education College in London. I was responsible for designing courses 
    for young musicians who wanted to make it in the music industry! 
    I am also pleased to tell you that we are all well, happily 
    married with loads of beautiful children!

[Goldring]
A6. Progressive music is very challenging to play, it takes 
    hours of practice and considerable skills and creativity. I enjoy 
    listening to this music, but don't seem to get the time to perform 
    it. I am currently enjoying playing improvised music in a band 
    called 'The Universe' which I find highly enjoyable - we will 
    shortly be releasing an album here in England.

[Goldring]
  A7. Never too old to rock and roll! I am playing better than 
    ever. I am afraid that I don't like much of what I hear of 
    modern bands. They seem too driven by commercial aspects rather 
    than making music they enjoy. In other words, they play music 
    they think people want to hear, rather than playing good music 
    for themselves. I also think that technology has had a bad effect 
    on developing the musical skills of bands and that lyricism and 
    musicality have suffered considerably. Having said that, I am 
    impressed with bands like Radiohead and Blur.

[Goldring]
  A9. I am not quite sure about this question. Progressive music started 
    because we were bored with the 3 minute pop song with no musical 
    interest and substance. Concerning beards and moustaches, I wish 
    we had enough hair to grow them now! Remember that I was 19 in 
    the picture and am now 47 years old!
