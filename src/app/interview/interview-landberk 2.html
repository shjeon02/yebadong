<b> Question 11. Lanberk's music is surely the one of the best tunes in '90s! In a monthly 
meeting of Islands (a 
proghead group in Korea), the song of "You and I" was selected as the best 
song in the meeting. The 
sound of mellotron was very impressive. I think that Mellotronen that Stefan 
Dimle works for has    
something to do with the instrument of mellotron. Do you have any creed in 
the great musical 
instrument of mellotron?<br>
