Hello Incheol!
Here are the answers to the questions you had about Anekdoten and our 
music. Sorry for the delay in getting this to you, but I have been very 
busy in the last couple of weeks. 

Give us a confirmation that this message has reached you safely. Let 
us know in case you need a group-picture for the article in the fanzine and 
I'll send one off. We would also very much appreciate if you could send us a 
copy of the fanzine when it is out. Thank you!
</pre>

<b> Question #1 :
Anekdoten's music is surely the one of the best tunes in '90s !
BTW, we can hear some influences of prog dinasaur King Crimson in your
music. Besides King Crimson, where do your main influences came from ? <p>

Question #2 :
After hearing 'Karelia(what is the meaning ?)'
the first track of Vemod,
I was completely blown away by your heavy sound. Jan, your bass is so powerful !
Some guys on the net often compare you with Bernard Paganotti(ex-Magma
bassist) or Chris Squire. What is your favourite bassist Jan ?
And which brand of bass guitar do you use on the stage ?

Answer #2 <br>
Karelia is a part of Finland. Most of Karelia (or Karjala in Finnish) was 
lost to Russia in the second world war, but a smaller part still belongs to 
Finland. <br>
I like John Wetton's playing with King Crimson and I'm also fond of Chris 
Squier sound. <br>
I use a Rickenbacker bass run through a H/H guitar-amp with built in 
distortion. <p>

Question #3
I've listened to live tapes of Progfest '94 and Progscape.
You played so well in the gigs, too ! And your cover of 'Starless'
in Progfest '94 was so brilliant. Who did suggest to play that
King Crimson's tune in Progfest '94 ? I would also like to know
what other songs you usually cover on the stage.

Answer #3 <br>

We had been playing Starless for quite some time and we thought that it 
would be a good idea to do it at Progfest if we would get an encore as it 
is a true progrock-classic.
<br> 
I think that our "cover-days" are more or less over by now, but we have 
been playing Mars/Devil's Triangle, Easy Money, Larks' Tongues In Aspic, 
Part 2, Cirkus and Lament by Crimson and Pilgrims with VdGG with Anekdoten.

Who is Nicholas' favourite guitarist ? And is there any additional musician

Answer #4
<br>
Jimi Hendrix and Robert Fripp are two of Nicklas favourite guitarists.
<br>
Anna Sofi and Nicklas share the keyboard duties both live and in studio, 
so if she's not busy playing cello she probably plays keyboards live.

<p></b><hr>
Answer #6
<br>
We really love both bands and I think that both bands have 
developed their sound if you compare their first and second 
releases.
<br>
There's a lot out there that I don't particularly like. Many bands are stuck 
in some Marillion-rehashing style and the music too often consists 
of syntheseizer-textures and guitar playing a la 80's for my tastes. 
<br>
In some aspects we don't see ourselves as a typical progband as we 
are perhaps too heavy for a lot of the prog-listeners. However there are 
many current bands that I do like and there's some very good stuff being 
released on record as well, so it seems like prog is alive and 
kicking! I have never been a neo-prog fan, though.

Question #8 :
Many of the Korean Anekdoten's fans seem to be crazy about your band's
cellist, Anna Sofi Dahlberg. We'd like to know the musical background of
Anna. When did she start her career as a prog rocker ?

She had been playing folkmusic and classical music on the cello before 
she joined Anekdoten. So Anekdoten is the only rock-group she have been 
playing with, but she had been listening to prog before she joined the 
band.

Question #9 :
This question goes to the drummer, Peter. Where does your main influence
come from ? Also I've heard from the net that you keep very intimate 
acquaintance of the Anglagard's drummer Mattias. How do you think about
his playing ?

Answer #9
<br>
Peter's biggest current influence is Christian Vander of Magma. He thinks 
that Mattias is a very good drummer and that his playing is very 
important for the Anglagard sound. Mattias will also almost certainly 
develop even further as he is still young.

Question #10 :
We're now anxiously wating for your next album. How much portion of
the new album recording was done so far ? And I know it maybe the
one of the top secrets, :-) what is the title of the upcoming new album ?
Will it be somewhat different from your debut album ?

Answer #10
<br>
We have just finished the recording of a pre-production with 5 "new" songs 
and there are also two more songs that will be rehearsed and arranged before 
we start the recording of the album. Our plan is to have the CD out in August 
1995.

<p>
The material may differ from Vemod in the way that we are using a 
"broader palette", with more different influences that shine through on the 
new material. The record will also most certainly be more "produced" and 
arranged, with more additional instruments appearing. I think that it will 
appeal to the old fans and hopefully also give us some new ones.
No title has yet been chosen for the new album.

Question #11 (new addition) :
The sleeve design of 'Vemod' is somewhat horrific to me.
It reminds me of kinda Black Sabbath album or other current
heavy metal group's album artwork. 
I'd like to know the reason why you choose the picture
as the sleeve design of your awesome album ? 
Have you got any influence from Death metal, black magic or
Satamism ?

Answer #11
<br>
The cover was thought out by Nicklas Berg and Michael Thorne (of the 
Swedish progressive band Catweasel). We all very much like the Hipgnosis 
school of cover-artwork and wanted to do something with a similar 
feeling. We are pretty happy with it, as it was a REAL low-budget session.
<br>
We were aware of the similarities to the first Black Sabbath album, but we 
are NOT AT ALL influenced by black magic or satanism (quite the opposite).
