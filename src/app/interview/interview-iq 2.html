Well, below you will find the answers to your questions which were sent to me
today by Peter. Hope they are to your satisfaction. The answers are unedited and
they appear exactly as it is on the paper Peter sent me. Would it be possible
for you to send me some of the responses you get from the interview when you
post it onto your BBS etc.? Thanks 

Speak to you soon,
Take care,

P.S. feel free to post it to `IAPH`, i`m sure they'd like to see it.

<b> Q1. I think the band's name IQ means Intellingence Quotient, right?
    Is there any special reason that you use IQ as your band's name? <p>

&bull;
Yes, IQ does stand for 'Intelligence Quotient' but we certainly didn't choose
the name because we're all intelligent! When the band was formed in 1981, nobody
could decide on a name. At the time, Mike was studying Psychology so, in
desperation, we got one of his books, opened it at any page and pointed at the
first word he saw, which was....IQ!<p>

<b>Q2. I can hear from your music that your main influence came from 
    Peter Gabriel. Is there any other artist that you received much

&bull;
Peter Gabriel was an influence in the early days and at first when I was
compared to him, I was quite flattered by it. But after a while, I got a bit fed
up with it because I really wanted people to see me as Peter Nicholls, I wanted
to be able to do my own thing. It's true that my vocal style was definitely
influenced by him when I started out, but now I feel like I just sing like me.
Lots of singers have influenced me over the years, male and female. The most
important quality of a good singer, for me, is someone who puts feeling and
expression and emotion into the performance. I love people like David Bowie,
Barbra Streisand, Tori Amos, The Beatles... <p>

Probably 'Ever'... it's the most consistent IQ album, the only one I can listen
to from start to finish without feeling awkward. I'm very proud of it. But i`m
also very fond of 'The Wake', too. Good strong songs.<p>

&bull;
There isn't a concept with 'TALES FROM THE LUSH ATTIC', each song is about a
different subject. But THE WAKE is definitely all about death. There's a story
running right through it, of a main character who dies, but it's much too
complicated to explain it all here. <p>

Thank you! I did a foundation course in Art a few years ago, and in fact my real
job is as a freelance illustrator, working mostly on children's comics and
books. I like the fact that, with IQ, I do all the artwork, we write all the
songs together, Mike produces the albums, and the whole thing is completely
self-contained, it's 100% IQ. <p>

<b> Q6. We often regard IQ along with Marillion ,Pallas and 12th Night
    as neo-prog bands. What do you think about other 2nd generation
    neo-prog bands like Marillion and Pallas?
    And what do you also think about your '90s decendants like
    Anglagard, Anekdoten, Echolyn etc? <p>

I always liked Pallas and Twelfth Night,(Geoff Mann was a good friend), but I
never really liked Marillion in the early days, I must admit. They're a lot
better now with Steve Hogarth. The latest bands I never get to hear, really. We
played with Anglagard in L.A. last year, but they weren't my kind of thing at
all. I've never heard Anekdoten and Echolyn.... <p>
