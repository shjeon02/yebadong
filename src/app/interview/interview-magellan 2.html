This interview was conducted in December 1994 via phone to Magellan's studio
in Vacaville, California. Wayne and Trent Gardner were hard at work on their
third Magna Carta album. while Trent was busy with a keyboard part Wayne was
kind enough to take a break to answer our questions... <p>

<b> Q1. We know that Magna Carta's first release is Magellan's "Hour of
Restoration." The second is shadow gallery's self-titled debut album and the
last one is "Impending Ascension" by Magellan. Are there any other albums
released by Magna Carta? And also, we're very curious to know about the Magna
Carta label and Mike Varney. Please give us a short history of Magna Carta.<p>

Wayne Gardner: So far, that's it. Cairo comes out in late January 1995. I
don't know if ours will be out in 'early '95' but it will definitely be out
in '95. It depends how fast we can jam through this. We want to take our
time. There are a few other possible releases, but those our still
confidential but will be very exciting. <p>

It was a joint idea between Mike Varney and Peter Morticelli. The saw the
niche that prog rock had. It had its own fans and fanzines but maybe wasn't
taken care of all that well by any American-based label especially the
heavier variety of prog. SI music and Musea has been around for awhile but
they don't lean towards the heavier side. They saw the opportunity and they
went for it. Pete handles the day-to-day sort of business and Mike is mostly
the A and R guy who handles the talent. <p>

WG: I wish I knew when it was coming out, as far as the exact date. I know
it will be out in '95 and we're trying to get it out as soon as possible.
Right now we still have a lot of work ahead of us so I can't pinpoint the
exact date for release. It's called "Test Of Wills" and if there's any theme
behind it is about struggling against the odds, that sort of thing. Remember
how Rush had "Grace Under Pressure"? We didn't have that in mind but it's a
similar kind of concept. Our's is better and  will sound heavier! (laughs) I
hesitate to call it a thematic thing or a concept album especially when we
get around to releasing all the track names. We have actually written them
out but it's not 100% solid. <p>

There's a possibility that we'll have a bonus track for Japan only or U.S.
only, we haven't decided. We have one song that's about 8 minutes long and
it's kind of in a different style so were not sure what to do with it yet.
Maybe we can sneak it on the album or something. <p>

Most of the stuff(for the new album) is heavier than that and is probably
heavier than the first two albums. Were not sure if it will fit. We like to
write albums in context to make sure it blends properly. We don't want it
sticking out like a sore thumb. That track sort of sticks out. <p>

together so fast and we started liking it. It came together faster than
almost anything we've ever done before. But then we started to record it and
we weren't sure 'cause we had so many others to record that we had to shelve
it for awhile. It was an anomaly for sure 'cause  usually everything we
write, we use. It's not like us to write a song and not use it, so it's
definitely one-of-a-kind. <p>

We're hoping that the third album will do a lot better because the first two
albums had a lot of long songs. Radio is a real key. Most of our stuff you
just couldn't air. Our short songs were too short to even play! "The Winner"
was that way. It was actually part of something longer but was condensed into
about a two minute song. So, look forward to the third one to have some
shorter stuff. There will still be long songs 'cause we still love to do
that. With the new album we've put the emphasis on good songwriting but we
need to explore the shorter areas but at the same time not wimp out! (laughs)
That's why I'm really excited about these new tunes. They rock! (laughs) <p>

WG: We have to see how well the album does. I'm sure if it does well that
record company will get us out there and say, "You guys just gotta tour!" It
will be expensive to get us out there. We may have to get one or two
drummers, possibly. It's pretty  expensive to go over to Japan with the
exchange rate being what it is. If it sells well there's a good chance.
That's the reason we haven't gone over with the first two albums. It's
prohibitively expensive. <p>

We actually spent a lot of time on "Impending Ascension" and by the time it

We have too may ideas now. We're just so anxious to get recording and doing
these new tunes. I really think we'll get the fourth album out noticeably
sooner than the first three. Now that we have our own recording equipment. We
can make the recordings better and faster. Instead of traveling long
distances back and forth to a studio which we've always done it the past,
staying up long nights, we can now do it much more comfortably. It's better
for the music 'cause we feel more creative. There's now pressure to get out
of the studio when our time is up. Those days are gone! <p>

We've spent more time on this one song than we've spent on any three of our
older songs. And were not even done with it yet! In fact, we're not even done
tracking it and then there's the mix on top of that. And that's just for a
five minute song. So, we're spending much more time. That's the only reason
we haven't cranked them out every week or something. We're able to relax,
able to do four, five, or six hours of recording a day. We've been at this
one song for two weeks. And we still have a lot of work to do! But, it's
gonna rule when it's done! (laughs) It's gonna be what we want. <p>

WG: Yes, we did quote these men. We had the Churchill quote and we had this
song about the Falkland Islands War and even though Churchill was obviously
not involved it sounded cool. It sounded almost generic enough that it fit in
with the concept. As regards Shakespeare, the studio we were recording at
used that quote as part of an advertisement. It just sounded so cool, it
sounded so good we just had to put it in a song someplace. So, we brought
that in to "Under The Wire." <p>

come out of the blue and do so well. They play them quite a bit on MTV. You
know, every time Rush come out they do well. The same with Tull, Floyd,
Genesis, and others. I thing prog-metal is doing fine. The only thing they
all have in common is major label support, which is critical. I think it
still has life. Before people get tired of 'prog metal' there needs to come
along another group with more 'hooks' or something. <p>

<b>Q9. In the Korean copy of Magellan's "Hour of Restoration" liner notes, it is
written that you didn't employ a drum machine when recording and inside the
booklet of "Impending Ascension" it was said that you use MIDI drum triggers
to record the drum parts. We Korean Magellan fans were very puzzled about it.
Is there any difference between the drum machine and MIDI drum triggers? Or
did you really play drums with the stick in your hand when recording your
first album (many Korean Magellan fans believe this to be so)? <p>

Perry perform the whole thing. He had his whole drum kit set up with MIDI. We
took all the MIDI information and inserted our own sounds. We picked all the
sounds but he did all the playing. I thought it worked out pretty well. It
has a lot of potential to sound even better. The third one? It'll probably
work out the same way except  that we have some new gear. <p>

I have a whole new guitar rig, thanks to Mike Varney. My amp literally fried.
It roasted! So Mike let me pick out one of his amps. I ended up borrowing the
amp and two guitars! So, I have a whole new guitar sound. I think it's

<b>Q10. The spaceship that appeared on the sleeve of "Hour of Restoration" looks
very cool and it reminded us of Yes' "Fragile" of near a score ago and
Pallas' "Sentinel" of 10 years ago. So I often consider those three albums as
the prog albums of the decade with a cool ship on their cover. Do you also

The guys from Tull are incredibly busy. Ian has his salmon farm. He has a
huge 'Tull' business. Plus his family, too. I'm surprised that the guys has
given us the time of day, but he has. So, we feel real lucky there. Ian's
tentatively scheduled to play on our album, at least on one track, if he can
get the time. If he can squeeze in some hours to do it, he'll do it. We
really hope so. We hope to just send him a song on ADAT (the digital format
Magellan and Cairo use to record) and it'd be real easy.

WG: Um...heavy prog, I guess. In some ways I'm leaning against calling it
'progressive' not because it isn't. We're obviously not in a state of denial.
I wasn't even aware of the term 'progressive' until the late 1980's or
something. I was listening to Rush and Yes and all that and had no idea it
was called progressive rock. Once in awhile I'd heard of 'art-rock' or
something-I just thought it was 'music', you know? I'd describe our stuff as
energetic. It' s not boring. I think we have, at least we try of r it anyway,
original chord progressions. We try to be unpredictable. We're always deadly
afraid of cliches. We try to avoid them if at all possible. 'Non-cliched

us back and said he thought the music was very mature. He really liked it a
lot. He suggested a name change (from "Streamline" as they were then known).I
had glasses on in the photo we sent him. He said 'I betcha that guy in the
glasses could come up with a good name'! Well, that was me and when the time
came around for us to sign the contract with Magna Carta we finally came
across Magellan. I was kind of thinking about it when he mentioned it, that
"Streamline" kind of sounds like a bus! Our music was changing a lot at the
time and it seemed like a good time. <p>

Trent and I actually started writing music in the late 70's. It was
progressive but not as heavy. Then the music started getting heavier and a
little more compact. I just thought it was going in a new direction. Once you
start putting out albums and all that and talking to people about it you
really start to realize where you're coming from. We needed a concept. Where
were we coming from? We really didn't used to think about that. We'd been
writing songs for year. We played live occasionally, that kind of stuff.
That's when we decided to get a new name due to Ian's suggestion and
solidified the concept of Magellan.

For the longest time I used Carvin. To be honest, I'm kind of tired of it, I
think. I think I need a change. And so my amp blew up. I thought, "Ah, a
perfect time to change." So, now I'm using Kramer, which I think is
out-of-business now. I'm using a Kramer 'Sustainer', I think it's called. It
has a like a built-in 'E-bow.' You just flick a switch and all your gain
notes are sustained instantly. It's killer! I've never used a tremolo before

it's like (in a mocking tone), "Uh oh, you know what that means-they're
selling out!" But we have the benefit of experience. You know how when
"Namzamo" by IQ came out? They were purposely writing these pop tunes. But
that's not gonna happen with us. There aren't any pop songs on here! (laughs)
They may be short but it's still definitely Magellan. It's still intense.
We're not falling into a typical song structure, though. At the same time
