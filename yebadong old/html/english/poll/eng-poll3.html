Hi, YBD fellows, Let me tell the result of Yes Poll.

The popularity of Yes does not seem to be large in YBD.  However, the 
people who had been listening progressive rock before the Italy progressive 
rock bands were introduced in Korea, has a more affection toward Yes. 
Thereafter, a lot of GREAT progressive rock bands were introduced, it 
was difficult to be mad about Yes as I think...

Shin In-cheol, Lee Kang-young, Kim Nam-Woong, and I participated in 
questionnaire. I wished more people participate in next questionnarire
as Pink Floyd to have more fans. 


<1> What's your favorite of YES ?

	1. Close to the Edge (3)
	2. Relayer	     (2)
	   Tales from Topographic Oceans 
	   Fragile	     
	3. Tormato	     (1) 
	   Yessongs
	   Yes Album

In my opinion, _Close to the Edge_ is the more progressive and Yes poured
their heart in this album. _Tales from Topographic Oceans_ is similar.
_Relayer_ has nice songs, like as _the Gate of Delirium_, _Sound Chaser_/
_Fragile_ finished the feature of Yes, finally.


<2> What's your favorite song of Yes ?

	1. The Gate of Delirium (3)

	   Don't kill the whale 
	   Future times/Rejoice
	   Mood for a day
	   Awaken
	   And you and I

The first song of _The Gate of Delirium_, _Relayer_ get a first ranks. In fact,
two men who recommend _Close to the Edge_ as a no.1 album, wrote the same song
