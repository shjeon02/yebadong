        		K I N G      C R I M S O N



1. What is your favourite King Crimson Album ?

    1. In the court of the Crimson King (4)
    1. Lark's tongues in aspic (4)
    3. Red (3)
    3. In the wake of Poseidon (3)
    5. Island (2)
    6. Lizard
       Starless and Bible Black
       21st century schizoid man
  
Early two albums and mid two albums competed..
Though quite distinct musical phases in the ranking, they
are equally lovable.



2. What is your favourite King Crimson song ?

    1. Starless (3)
    1. Epitaph (3)
    3. Lark's tongues in Aspic part 1 (2)
    3. 21st century schizoid man (2)
    3. In the wake of Poseidon (2)
    3. Island (2)
    7. Exiles
       Sailor's Tale
       In the court of the Crimson King
       Lizard
       Red
       Thela Hun Ginjeet 

As expected, two classic Starless and Epitath got tied to top..
At the point of album, the best is ItCotCk from which three songs rank..



3.  What is your least favourite King Crimson album ?

    1. Beat (2)
    1. Three of a perfect pair (2)
    1. In the wake of Poseidon (2)
    4. Discipline
    4. Lark's tongues in Aspic
    4. Island

All the 80's albums have been appeared.. :-)
It seems that the Adrian Belew's modern sound doesn't appeal to those
who love the vangard sound of early&mid periods,
although I do not so hateful.
I guess the reason why ItWoP fight a good(?) battle is that it
is similiar to the debut album. What do you think of that?
Unexpectedly, LTiA got a vote...

4. What is your least favourite King Crimson song ?

    1. The letters
       Ladies of the Road
       Any song from the last three albums (Discipline, Beat, ToaPP)
       Starless and bible black
       Sleepless
       Neil and Jack and Me

All the 80's songs have been appeared, as well.. :-)
I voted to Starless and Bible Black. The reason is that, just 10 years ago,
every time when I requested the f*cking D.J. to play "Starless"
at a customary cafe, he played this song... :-)


5. What is your favourite King Crimson era ?

     Phase #				Albums
     1st Phase	****			ItCotCK, ItWotP
     2nd Phase	*			Lizard, Island, Earthbound
     3rd Phase  **			LTiA, SaBB, Red, USA
     4th Phase 				Discipline, Beat, ToaPP

I expected that 3rd phase would win, but 1st phase got to win
because of the strong breath steam of ItCoCK..!!


6. What is your favourite member of King Crimson ?
     (You can include session(non-official) members...
      e.g. Jon Anderson in Lizard)
     (You can select non-regular member of KC
      e.g. Jon Anderson in Lizard)

      1. Robert Fripp (7)
      2. Bill Bruford (4)
      3. Greg Lake (3)
      4. Pete Sinfield (2)
      4. John Wetton (2)
      6. Keith Tippett
         Adrian Belew

Fripp is top, of course.. Keith Tippett, who has brilliant Jazz piano
playing in cat food, and Adrian Belew got a vote each..


7. What is your least favourite member of King Crimson ?

      1. John Wetton (2)
      1. Greg lake (2)
      3. Tony Levin
      3. Ian McDonald

Bassist is not so much popular.. :-) In my thought, Tony Levin got
a vote, not because Tony Levin is a good bassist but because
the impression of his looking. I have a simpathy about that.. :-)


8. If you were Robert Fripp, Who would you like to play with
   in the banner of New KC ?
   (You can recruit non ex-Crimson member)
       
     1. guitar: Robert 'Libero' Fripp
        vocal: Greg Lake
        drums/percussion:Bill Bruford
        violin:Mauro Pagani
        lyrics:Peter Sinfield
 
     2. guitar: Robert 'Budgie' Fripp
        vocal: Peter Hammill
        bass: John Myung
        drums/percussion : Bill Bruford
        violin: Graham Smith
        lyrics:Peter Sinfield

     3. guitar:Robert 'K.Y.' Fripp
        vocal: Peter Sinfield
        bass: Chris Squire
        drums/percussion: Bill Bruford
        lyrics:Peter Sinfield

     4. guitar:Robert 'Ork-Man' Fripp
        vocal:Annie Haslam + Klaus Blasquiz
        bass: Bernard Paganotti + Jannick Top
        drums/percussion: Bill Bruford + Daniel Denis
                          Carl Palmer(Timpani)
        cello/synth: Thierry Zaboitzeff
        string quartet:Kronos Quartet
        lyrics:excerpts from Bible in Hibrian

     5. guitar:Robert 'HongSeok' Fripp

        drums/percussion:Bill Bruford
        lyrics:Fish

     6. guitar:Robert 'Fish' Fripp
        vocal: Diane Schurr
        bass: Tony Levin
        drums/percussion: Bill Bruford
        sax: Raphael Ravenscroft
        lyrics:Adrian Belew

It seems like that Bruford is Fripp's most trustable musician.. 
The team of Ork-Man is really splended, from Magma to Art Zoyd..
The result shows the each one's various musical tastes...


       
9. What is your favourite Fripp featuring album except for 
   King Crimson's albums ?
        
        I advance masked (with Andy Summers)
        Fool's mate (Peter Hammill)
It's so strange that the albums such like Evening star(Joint album with
Eno) has not been appeared..



10. Please list three artists that you think to be deeply
   influenced by King Crimson.(e.g. BiKyoRan, Anekdote, etc...)

        1. Shylock (3)
        2. Anekdoten (2)
           Circus
           BiKyoRan 
        3. Cathedral (1)
           Osanna
           PFM

The top group, Shylock has a perfect Crimson model by the album
Gialorgues..
Anekdoten, exhibited the 90'era Crimson sound, has been ranked with
second place by a narrow margin.
