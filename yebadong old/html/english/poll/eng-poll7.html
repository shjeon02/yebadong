	    BRITISH SUPER PROGRESSIVE GROUP POLL # 5


                  G   E   N   E   S   I   S


1. What is your favourite Genesis album ?

   1. Foxtrot (5)
      Nursery Cryme (5)
      Selling England by the Pound (5)
   4. Trespass (4)
   5. The Lamb lies down on Broadway (2)

   It is very interesting that 3 albums tied to top rank.


2. What is your least favourite Genesis album ?

   1. We Can't Dance (4)
   2. Invisible Touch (3)
   3. Duke (1)
      Three Sides Live (1)
      From genesis to Revelation (1)
      Abacab (1)
      Collins era album before they turned to pop-group (1)

   Haha.. the lastest two albums after Genesis has turned to a pop graup
   got the first and second rank.
   The debut album fGtR got one vote. Maybe it's because they were still in
   'Bubble Gum Sound' of '60s in their first work.
   And the guy who said 'Collins era album before they turned to pop-group'
   seems very ambiguous. Is it 'A Trick of the Tail' and 'Wind and Wuthering'?
   Or also 'Duke' and 'And Then There were Three'?? :-)


3. What is your favourite Genesis song ?

   1. Supper's Ready (4)
      Dancing with the moonlite knight (4)
   3. Fountain of Salmacis (3)
   4. The Knife (2)
      The Musical Box (2)
   6. Harold the Barrel (1)
      Seven Stones (1)
      White Mountain (1)
      Mama (1)
      Firth of Fifth (1)
      One for the vine (1)
   
   Again two songs got tied to top!! :-)
   I feel sorry that there isn't 'Watcher of the Skies' which is always
   highly ranked in abraod Genesis polls.
   And 'Mama' got one vote for the only song of 'Collins era'. I remember
   the music video of this song which was very fascinating to me.


4. What is your least favourite Genesis song ?

   1. Mama (1)
      We Can't Dance (1)
      Abacab (1)
      All songs without Gabriel (1) 
      Invisible Touch (1)
      Land of Freedom (1)
      Watcher of the Skies (1)

   Again there is 'Mama'!
   Almost everyone quited to answer for this question.


5. What is your favourite Genesis member ?

    1. Peter Gabriel (7)
    2. Tony Banks (5)
       Steve Hackett (5)
    4. Phil Collins (3)
    5. Anthony Phillips (1) 

   Everybody in YBD convinced that Genesis is the band of Gabriel by this
   result!!! 
   And, it's an unexpected result that there were many votes to Tony Banks 
   who played keyboard sonorously even if not gorgeously. :-)
   Also one vote to early member Anthony Phillips seems extraordinary.
   

6. What is your least favourite Genesis member ?

    1. Phil Collins (3)
    2. Mike Rutherford (1)
    3. Steve Hackett (1)

   Phil Collins proved to be the least favourite Genesis member for
   he led Genesis music to 'sold out pops' even if he made the present
   'Popular' Genesis.


7. What is your favourite era in Genesis' carrer ?

  * 1. Gabriel Period (fGtR, Trespass, NC, Foxtrot, GL, tLLDoB, SEBtP)
    2. Hackett, Rutherford, Banks, Collins Period (SO, W&W, TotT)
    3. Collins Period (And then there were three....)

   An unanimous result!!
   

8. What is your favourite solo album of the Genesis members ?

    1. Steve Hackett / The Voyage of the Acolyte (4)
    2. Peter Gabriel / 3rd (3)
    3. Peter Gabriel / 4th (1)
       Tony Banks / Still (1)
       Anthony Philips / The Geese and the Ghost (1)
       Phil Collins / O.S.T. Against all odds (1)

   Gabriel's 3rd and Hackett's tVotA got the most votes as expected.
   Bank's solo stuff got one vote in which Fish(of Marillion) took part
   as a guest.


9. Which artist do you think to be most Genesis-influenced ?

    1. Marillion (7)
       (including 1 vote for Marillion and many other neo-prog bands)
    2. IQ (2)
       Acqua Fragile (2)
       (including 1 vote for most of Italian symphonic group,
        Acqua Fragile and mid era PFM)
    4. Neuschwanstein (1)
       Acqua Fragile (1)
       Banco (1)
       Skryvania (1)
       Saga (1)
       Mid '70s British prog bands, such as England, Fruupp (1)
       Neo classical fusion guitarist, Yngwie Malsteen
       , Tony MaCalpine (1)

  Haha.. Marillion got to top at last!!! :-)
  We can conceive that how much Genesis influenced to Euroupian prog bands
  by seeing the nationalities of the bands which appear in this vote:
  - two Italy bands, Acqua Fragile and Banco
  - Neuschwanstein of Germany
  - Skryvania of France
  - Saga of Canada even if it's not an Euroupian band.
  And also classical fusion guitarists - I believe that Tony is Tony 
  MaCalpine, am I right??

  My last comment for this Genesis poll result is that this 'world class
  super rock group' is too underestimated and misunderstood in our country.



  Thanks a million !!!
