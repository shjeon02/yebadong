               BRITISH SUPER PROGRESSIVE GROUP POLL #2

                   	P I N K   F L O Y D


1. What is your favourite Pink Floyd Album?

    1. Wish you were here (10)
    2. The Wall (9)
    3. The dark side of the moon (8)
    4. Atom Heart Mother (3)
       Animals (3)
    6. The final cut (1)
       Ummagumma
       Meddle 

   Well, as expected, 'Wish you were here' gained the most votes
   among Korean fans. There was a close race between 'The Wall'
   'The Dark Side of the Moon'. It was very interesting for me
   to observe such a tight competition !


2. What is your least favourite Pink Floyd Album?

    1. A momentary lapse of reason (6)
    2. Animals (4)
    3. Delicate sound of thunder (2)
       More (2)
    5. The dark side of the moon (1)
       Obscured by Clouds
       Meddle
       The Wall
       The final cut
       A saucerful of secrets

   Our result of this category was found out to be very similar to
   other internet poll result. Maybe David's new Pink Floyd got success 
   in charting and selling, but they seems to be failed to satisfy
   their all time die-hard fans. 
   As for 'Animals', although it gained three votes at
   'The fave album catergory' also did very well in "Least fave category"
   , too ! I think the relative less popularity of 'Animals' came from
   the fact that Roger's sudden dictatorship at this album.
   From this album, Rick's role in songwriting reduced to almost
   undetecatable range, even worse, there's no definite evidence
   that Rick participated in recording 'Animals'.
   The moody and psychedelic sound that once a trademark for Floyd 
   was actually ended up after 'Wish you were Here'. From 'Animals',
   Floyd actively started to make more 'lyrics-oriented', more
   'sarcasm-oriented' music. Maybe I can say Floyd turned to more
   'commercial'(Oh, well, Dare I say 'commercial ?') and strong
   sound. The success of Animals gave Roger a motivation to
   prepare for rock's monumental masterpiece, 'The Wall'.
   'More' and 'Obscured by Clouds' often regarded as the least
   faves by many Floyd fans and we also had the similar result.
   They have one thing in common, both are soundtracks !
   Maybe 'More' has some 'non-Floydian' moments since it was made
   for a Film and 'Obscured by Clouds' might be obscured by
   its succeeding album 'The dark side of the moon'.
   Well, 'Obscured by tDSoTM' Right ? :-)
 

3. What is your favourite Pink Floyd song?

    1. Shine on you crazy diamond (5)
    2. Comfortably numb (4)
       Wish you were here (4)
       The great gig in the sky (4)
    5. Time (3)
    6. Another brick in the wall part 2 (2)
    7. Run like hell (1)
       A saucerful of secrets
       Welcome to the machine
       Us and Them
       Echoes
       Hey you
       Is there anybody out there ?
       The gunner's dream
       Southampton dock/The final cut
       The post war dream

 As all of you might expected, 'Shine on you crazy diamond' won
 the most favourite song category !

 The second fave song was turned out to be 'Comfortably numb' !
 This song was supposed to be used on David's first solo album,
 but later Roger put his emotional lyrics into the song and made
 this song as a highlight of 'The Wall'. David and Roger sang
 the verses in turn. The interesting thing is, Rick and Guy Pratt
 sang the Roger's part in 'Delicate sound of Thunder' tour
 (although in a slightly modified melody) and Van Morrison
 (some guys refer him as Van 'Horrison', but who cares. :-))
 sang David's part on Berlin Wall concert.
 Which version do you prefer ?

 At the very beginning, 'The great gig in the sky' received
 the most of votes at this category. So I blindly thought that
 'the great gig in the sky' would win #1 ! But this was turned out
 to be not the case after all the votes throwing in.
 I hoped Rick would write a song like 'the great gig in the sky'
 in 'The division bell'. I mean instrumental song with female scat. :-)
 'Wish you were here', typified by David's Dylan-esque vocal, 
  acoustic guitar and Roger's mind-blowing lyrics got 4 votes.
  And the long time Floyd classic 'Time' was also doing very well. 

 In my humble opinion, I was somewhat disappointed to see 'Echoes'
 came up with only one vote. 'Echoes' always had been doing very well
 in other Floyd polls, but failed to be top fave songs in our poll result.
 Personally, I like it very much, especially the vocal duet shared by
 David and Rick, it's just beautiful !

 It was very interesting to notice 'A saucerful of secrets' ranked.
 Which version of this fantastic song do you guys prefer ?
 Live version in 'Ummagumma' ? or studio version featuring
 beautiful chorus ?

 As for die-hard Roger's fan, I'm very pleased to see some of the
 tunes from 'The Final Cut' ranked. Sometimes 'The Final Cut'
 seems to be relatively unpopular since it leans somewhat towards
 Roger's solo album. Their might be an unexpected help by
 Korean CF which features tunes from this album, Huh ?


4. What is your least favourite Pink Floyd song ?

    1. The dogs of war (3)
    2. Dogs
       Sheep
       Pigs
       Several species of small  furry animals gathered together
       in a cave and grooving with a pict
       Free Four
       Apples and Oranges
       Take it back
       Most tracks in _A momentary lapse of reason_.

 Unexpectedly, the # 1 song in this category
 coincides with other world-wide poll result.
 Songs from 'Animals' got 1 vote each, and 'Several species...'
 from 'Ummagumma' also came up with one vote. 
 It seems songs about 'Animals' not popular among Korean Floyd fans.
 I once had a nightmare after hearing 'Several species...'
 Pheww !! it can be such a fear-inducing song ! :-)


5. Who is your favourite Pink Floyd member ?

    1. David John Gilmour (7)
    2. George Roger Waters (5)

  A talented musician as he may be, the great vocalist and guitarist
  David Gilmour supressed Roger, awesome lyricist, mind-blowing
  conceptist, not talented bassist(:-)) by two votes.
  Roger did not actively participate in playing bass from 'Animals'.
  The beautiful fretless bass sound at the intro of 'Hey You'
  is actually David's playing. It is also not well known that the late
  Jeff Porcaro played drums in 'Mother'.
  

6. Who is your least favourite Pink Floyd member ?

    1. George Roger Waters (3)
    2. Nicholas Berkley Mason (2)
    3. Roger Keith Syd Barrett (1)
       David John Gilmour 
  
    Haha !! Roger won ! Since he sometimes thought to be
    responsible for Pink Floyd disbanding, he failed to get
    much popularity from Korean Floyd fans.


7. What is your favourite solo album of Pink Floyd members ?
    
    1. The pros and cons of hitchhiking / Roger Waters (5)
    2. Amused to death / Roger Waters (2)
    3. Radio KAOS /Roger Waters (1)
       The Wall live in Berlin / Roger Waters 
       Madcap Laughs / Syd Barrett
       Profiles /Nick Mason and Rick Fenn

     One of my all time favourite albums, 'The Pros and Cons..'
     won this category. Roger cries, moans, screams in this album !
     Some guys who do not like Roger's biting vocal style
     generally hates this album.
     It is interesting to notice Nick Mason and Rick Fenn' joint
     album and Syd Barrett's album charted in this category.
     I'm really disappointed to see David's first solo album
     got no votes !


8. What is your least favourite solo album of Pink Floyd members ?

    1. The pros and cons of hitchhiking / Roger Waters (3)
    2. About Face / David Gilmour (2)
    3. Music from The Body / Roger Waters and Ron Geesin (1)
       Everything (1) 

     Haha !!! Roger won again !
     'Everything' is very interesting answer though...


9. What is your favourite Pink Floyd era?

     David-Rick-Nick (0)                      tDB

      Our unanimous votes goes to the glory era of Pink Floyd !
      As shown, 12 of YeBaDong'ers participated in this poll.
 

10.  When did you first listen to Pink Floyd song?
   
    1979 *
    1980 *
    1981 *
    1983 *
    1986 **
    1987 *
    1989 ****
    1992 *


11. Which Pink Floyd Song did you listen to for the first time ?
    
    1. Time (5)
    2. Another brick in the wall part2 (4)
    3. Wish you were here (1)
       Any colour you like 
       In the flesh
      
      The number one went to 'Time', which is used so frequently
      as effects in TV drama etc. About ten years ago, DJ Kim
      Chang Wan said in his 'Pink Floyd Special' that
      Floyd might be explained as the group who says
      'Good Morning' as 'Gninrom Doog', since they use many 
      interesting and shocking effets in their music !
      Nowadays, the character of Floyd as 'musician with novel effect'
      very much paled. We can hear the more shocking effect from
      Michael Jackson's music and some rap songs. :-)
      
     
12. Which Pink Floyd album did you buy for the first time ?

     1. The dark side of the moon (6)
     2. The Wall (5)
     3. Meddle (1)


13. Which Pink Floyd album did you purchase most recently ?

     1. The division bell (2)
        Wish you were here (2)
        Meddle (2)
     3. The dark side of the moon (20th anniversary edition) (1)
        Delicate sound of thunder 
        Delicate sound of thunder(LD) 
        A momentary lapse of reason
        The final cut
        The Wall live in Berlin(by Roger Waters)

     Only two people in YeBaDong purchased 'The Division Bell'
     till now. I think 'Berlin the Wall' should be regarded as
     Roger's solo album. :-)


14. Which party do you think 'more-Floydian' ?
    Roger ? or the current incarnation of Floyd ?
    
    1. the Current Pink Floyd (6)
    2. Roger Waters (and the Bleeding heart Band) (3)
    2. None of the above
       (Pink Floyd died after Roger's went off ! ) (3)

    We YeBaDong'ers raised the hands of David, Rick and Nick !!


15. After 200 years from now on, Which Pink Floyd album
    can be remebered by our descendants ?

    1. The Wall (7)
    2. The dark side of the moon (5)

    At first, I thought 'The dark side of the moon' to be #1
    in this category regarding its niche in rock history and
    in terms of sales, too. But 'The Wall' won #1 in
    YeBaDong historical album of Pink Floyd !!
     
    
    ----------

    Long Live Floyd !!!!
