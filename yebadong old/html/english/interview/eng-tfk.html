Hi, Long Dal,

Sorry that you have to wait so long for my interview answers
My best to you and  YeBaDong subscribers.
Here's the answers .



[anwook@brave.yonsei.ac.kr]

:1. I think TFK's all albums are really great in '90 prog scene.
:   But if I have to choice only one album, I will do "Retropolis" as
:   my desert island cd. Could you recommend which album have to be
:   listened first among TFK's albums (for new listeners) ?


[Roine Stolt]

Well, I really don't know, maybe "Stardust We Are" .....there are so
many different songs and styles, it showcases all that is  typical
FlowerKings.
It is both complex and easy to listen to.
I know Retropolis is a favourite among lots of fans .
that's good ....it started out as a leftovers album project...and ended up
as a full production.


[anwook@brave.yonsei.ac.kr]

:2. I've heard that TFK was getting into a new project with
:   members of Spock's Beard, Marillion and Dream theater.
:   I wonder what sound it has ? Must it be great?


[Roine Stolt ]

Yes, the group is named  "Transatlantic", we had so much fun recording
it in June and July  -99.
It's me, Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater, Neal Morse of Spocks Beard and
Pete Trewavas of Marillion.
They are all so full of music.
The album will be released in March 2000.


[anwook@brave.yonsei.ac.kr]

:3. My feelings about your guitar sound is really extraordinary
:   (of course your voice,too ^^) from bluzzy sound in 'Pilgrims Inn' of
:   'TFK' album to spacy soaring thing in 'Compassion' of 'Stardust We Are'
:   album. IMHO, you seems firstly to concentrate on the composition and
:   try to fit your playing into that. So, end results always be good.
:   Many people resemble your guitar sounds to diverse genre guitarist,
:   Stewe Howe, Joe Satriani, Andy Latimer, Alan Holdsworth, Steve Vai....
:   Could you tell who most inspire your great sounds ?


[Roine Stolt]

I like all the guitarist you've mentioned ....
But many more inspiered me ... Pat Metheny , George Wadenius, Carlos
Santana, Robin Trower,Frank Zappa,Bob Fripp, Peter Green, Steve Hackett,BB
King, David Gilmour , David Lindley , George Harrison, Adrian Belew.,
Yngvie Malmsteen, David Thorn , Jimi Hendrix  ....
But also I listen to many Keyboardists... the phrasing is most important.



[GTO330@chollian.net]

:4. I am sorry now I'd like to know Original form of Mr. Doctor.
:   As I know the Flower king, Devill Doll, White Willow, etc,
:   played the Scandinavian Progressive Rock Festival in Gothenburg
:   on 30- 31th of Oct 1998. So, you may hobnob with Mr.Doctor.
:   How vice is he ?  he has really Doctor license ?
:   :-)  I am Mr. nurse.



[Roine Stolt]

: Sorry ,we didn't play that festival .... I don't think we were ever
: supposed to .....who told ou  ??
: what's more I don't  think Devil Doll is that interesting ....it's to dark
: depressing music to fit my taste .


[GTO330@chollian.net]

:5. Let's share in your view. What is the best line up in the
:   world ? What is true sense of Progressive Rock ?


[Roine Stolt]

You can never know what line up is good until you've tried it .....
it's not only a question of good musicianship ....
it's more a question of chemistry between members.
Progressive rock is music that dare to try new and  uncommon ways .
But also a label of the experimental rock of the late 60: ies and 70: ies .




[icshin@bioneer.kaist.ac.kr]

:6. What is your favourite prog artist in current prog scene ?


[Roine Stolt]

I like King Crimson most, because they are ....progressive ..... it always
sound frech.
I like a lot of the Dream Theater  stuff and  a lot of the Spocks Beard
stuff......
Peter Gabriel is still fresh and  Yes is my all time favourites  ...their
shows are still full of great music and  vital energy .


[icshin@bioneer.kaist.ac.kr]

:7. Some guys would define your music as somewhere cross between
:   neo prog and symphonic in the '70s. Do you find it somewhat
:   uncomfortable if your music is regarded as neo ?


[Roine Stolt]

I don't mind, it's just a label.
however I find our music lightyears  !!!  apart from  neo -bands like Arena
, Pendragon , IQ   as we're dealing with  far more complex rhythm
structures and   harmonic textures ,
It's up to anyone who listen  to our stuff to label as whatever ....I don't
care .... it's just music .



[icshin@bioneer.kaist.ac.kr]

:8. Is there any plan to record songs in your mother tongue ?
:   Of course I'm not saying that I don't like your English vocal,
:   but I think it would be quite cool if you just throw in a
:   few tracks with Swedish vocal so that we can appreciate
:   more Nordic feel from your music.


[Roine Stolt]

I don't think so, as we have  90 % of our listers  outside of Sweden .
And what's more  ...we have some  kind of message ...it won't be
understandable in Swedish  .


[icshin@bioneer.kaist.ac.kr]

:9. Do you happen to know that there are some dedicated fans
:   of yours in Korea ? Is there any plan for a gig in
:   far east ?


[Roine Stolt]

I didn't know we had  fans in Korea....... where do you get our  CD's  from  ??
We'd love to play Korea ,    we played Japan in March this year ...and we
recorded shows, it will be on our  new Live CD  , out in February  2000.




[shjeon@yebadong.kaist.ac.kr]

:10. I like your music very much. But the people who like progressive
:   rock music is much less than modern rock, techno, rap, etc.
:   I think that both of Kaipa, TFK are far from commercial gains. You
:   seem to ignore money. Have you ever been temptated by commercial
:   purpose ? And I'd like to know the reason why you love prog rock.
:   Is it silly question? *:-)
:   ( I'm also curious to know your opinion about current popular music
:   like modern rock, techno, rap, etc )



[Roine Stolt]

I like so many  kinds of music ,  I  even like pop music  like ABBA,
Hanson, Fleetwood Mac, Sting, Beatles,     I like rock  ....Aerosmith,
Billy Idol, David Bowie, The Eagles, .......
I like Jazz,....Miles Davis, Wheater Report, Chic Corea, Keith Jarret, Tony
Williams ....
I 'm not that interested in Techno   ...it's to monotone for me ..... I
think Rap is boring ....

I love Andrew Lloyd Webber stuff......
Old musical themes ...I love it .




[kikimomo@hitel.net]

:11. I hear some influence of 70's group like Genesis, Yes, and
:   King Crimson in TFK music. Do you feel nostalgia for 70's prog
:   like many old prog fans?

[Roine Stolt]

I've listened to them among loads of other stuff.....love  most of it .
I guess they influence me still .


[kikimomo@hitel.net]

:12. When do you expect to put out the next TFK album? Also are you going to
:   include long track (e.g. Garden of Dream, Stardust We are) on the next
:   album?

[Roine Stolt]

We release   new Live double Cd   called ...ALIVE ON PLANET EARTH     in
February 9th  2000.
recordings from North America -98 and Japan-99.
It's really good ......contains  our unique  version of Genesis classic
Lamb Lies Down ....
Next studio album will be released   in late April  next year .


I  say hello to our fans in Korea,
hope to see you in live concert in near future ...

Best regards,
Roine Stolt .
