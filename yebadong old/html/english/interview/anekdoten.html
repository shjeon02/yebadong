<pre>Hello Incheol!
Here are the answers to the questions you had about Anekdoten and our 
music. Sorry for the delay in getting this to you, but I have been very 
busy in the last couple of weeks. 
&nbsp;
Give us a confirmation that this message has reached you safely. Let 
us know in case you need a group-picture for the article in the fanzine and 
I'll send one off. We would also very much appreciate if you could send us a 
copy of the fanzine when it is out. Thank you!</pre>
<p><hr> <b>Question #1 : Anekdoten's music is surely the one of the best tunes 
in '90s ! BTW, we can hear some influences of prog dinasaur King Crimson in 
your music. Besides King Crimson, where do your main influences came from ? 
</b></p>
<p><hr> Answer #1 <br>
Van der Graaf Generator, Magma, early Pink Floyd, Cream, early Black Sabbath, 
David Sylvian, Talk Talk, Gentle Giant, Kyuss, the Beatles etc. </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #2 : After hearing 'Karelia(what is the meaning ?)' the 
first track of Vemod, I was completely blown away by your heavy sound. Jan, 
your bass is so powerful ! Some guys on the net often compare you with Bernard 
Paganotti(ex-Magma bassist) or Chris Squire. What is your favourite bassist 
Jan ? And which brand of bass guitar do you use on the stage ? </b></p>
<p><hr> Answer #2 <br>
Karelia is a part of Finland. Most of Karelia (or Karjala in Finnish) was lost 
to Russia in the second world war, but a smaller part still belongs to Finland. 
<br>
I like John Wetton's playing with King Crimson and I'm also fond of Chris Squier 
sound. <br>
I use a Rickenbacker bass run through a H/H guitar-amp with built in distortion. 
</p>
<p><hr><b> Question #3 I've listened to live tapes of Progfest '94 and Progscape. 
You played so well in the gigs, too ! And your cover of 'Starless' in Progfest 
'94 was so brilliant. Who did suggest to play that King Crimson's tune in Progfest 
'94 ? I would also like to know what other songs you usually cover on the stage. 
</b></p>
<p><hr> Answer #3 <br>
We had been playing Starless for quite some time and we thought that it would 
be a good idea to do it at Progfest if we would get an encore as it is a true 
progrock-classic. <br> I think that our &quot;cover-days&quot; are more or less 
over by now, but we have been playing Mars/Devil's Triangle, Easy Money, Larks' 
Tongues In Aspic, Part 2, Cirkus and Lament by Crimson and Pilgrims with VdGG 
with Anekdoten. </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #4 : Some guys often compare Nicholas' guitar playing with 
Robert Fripp. Who is Nicholas' favourite guitarist ? And is there any additional 
musician on the stage to play mellotrons while he plays guitar ? </b></p>
<p><hr> Answer #4 <br>
Jimi Hendrix and Robert Fripp are two of Nicklas favourite guitarists. <br>
Anna Sofi and Nicklas share the keyboard duties both live and in studio, so 
if she's not busy playing cello she probably plays keyboards live. </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #5 : We know there were many great prog artists in Sweden. 
What is your favourite '70s prog ancestor in Sweden ? </b></p>
<p><hr> Answer #5 <br>
Trettioariga Kriget, Life, Saga and Bo Hansson. </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #6 : I know you're friends with Anglagard and Landberk. 
How do you think about Anglagard and Landberk ? Also I'd like to hear your frank 
opinion on currently active other prog bands. </b></p>
<p><hr> Answer #6 <br>
We really love both bands and I think that both bands have developed their sound 
if you compare their first and second releases. <br>
There's a lot out there that I don't particularly like. Many bands are stuck 
in some Marillion-rehashing style and the music too often consists of syntheseizer-textures 
and guitar playing a la 80's for my tastes. <br>
In some aspects we don't see ourselves as a typical progband as we are perhaps 
too heavy for a lot of the prog-listeners. However there are many current bands 
that I do like and there's some very good stuff being released on record as 
well, so it seems like prog is alive and kicking! I have never been a neo-prog 
fan, though. </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #7 : Here goes some non-music releated questions. You look 
so young as appeared on the booklet of 'Vemod' Would you please let me know 
the birth year (if possible birth dates, too !) of your band members ? </b></p>
<p><hr> Answer #7 <br>
Nicklas Berg, Born in July 1969 <br>
Anna Sofi Dahlberg, Born in July 1970 <br>
Jan Erik Liljestrom, Born in September 1967 <br>
Peter Nordin, Born in February(?) 1970 </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #8 : Many of the Korean Anekdoten's fans seem to be crazy 
about your band's cellist, Anna Sofi Dahlberg. We'd like to know the musical 
background of Anna. When did she start her career as a prog rocker ? </b></p>
<p><hr> Answer #8 <br>
She had been playing folkmusic and classical music on the cello before she joined 
Anekdoten. So Anekdoten is the only rock-group she have been playing with, but 
she had been listening to prog before she joined the band. </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #9 : This question goes to the drummer, Peter. Where does 
your main influence come from ? Also I've heard from the net that you keep very 
intimate acquaintance of the Anglagard's drummer Mattias. How do you think about 
his playing ? </b></p>
<p><hr> Answer #9 <br>
Peter's biggest current influence is Christian Vander of Magma. He thinks that 
Mattias is a very good drummer and that his playing is very important for the 
Anglagard sound. Mattias will also almost certainly develop even further as 
he is still young. </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #10 : We're now anxiously wating for your next album. How 
much portion of the new album recording was done so far ? And I know it maybe 
the one of the top secrets, :-) what is the title of the upcoming new album 
? Will it be somewhat different from your debut album ? We just can't wait !! 
</b></p>
<p><hr> Answer #10 <br>
We have just finished the recording of a pre-production with 5 &quot;new&quot; 
songs and there are also two more songs that will be rehearsed and arranged 
before we start the recording of the album. Our plan is to have the CD out in 
August 1995. </p>
<p>The material may differ from Vemod in the way that we are using a &quot;broader 
palette&quot;, with more different influences that shine through on the new 
material. The record will also most certainly be more &quot;produced&quot; and 
arranged, with more additional instruments appearing. I think that it will appeal 
to the old fans and hopefully also give us some new ones. No title has yet been 
chosen for the new album. </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #11 : Would you please say hello to your fans in Korea, 
especially at prog mailinglist YeBaDong ? </b></p>
<p><hr> Answer # 11 <br>
Hello YeBaDong! It's nice to, at last, have some contact with the prog-fans 
in Korea! </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #11 (new addition) : The sleeve design of 'Vemod' is somewhat 
horrific to me. It reminds me of kinda Black Sabbath album or other current 
heavy metal group's album artwork. I'd like to know the reason why you choose 
the picture as the sleeve design of your awesome album ? Have you got any influence 
from Death metal, black magic or Satamism ? </b></p>
<p><hr> Answer #11 <br>
The cover was thought out by Nicklas Berg and Michael Thorne (of the Swedish 
progressive band Catweasel). We all very much like the Hipgnosis school of cover-artwork 
and wanted to do something with a similar feeling. We are pretty happy with 
it, as it was a REAL low-budget session. <br>
We were aware of the similarities to the first Black Sabbath album, but we are 
NOT AT ALL influenced by black magic or satanism (quite the opposite). </p>
<p><hr><b> And finally, How much cost do you expect for you to come here to 
play some gigs ? </b></p>
<p><hr> This is very hard to estimate. We will at least need to have the travel-cost 
and lodging paid and also some money apart from that. Please contact us if this 
thought develops further so we can discuss this more thoroughly. </p>
