<hr size="4" width="50%"> Hi Incheol, <br>
<br>
I'm so sorry that it took such a long time to get our answers. We have had very 
bad contacts in the band lately. I appreciated your reminding e-mails. Thanks 
a lot for your understanding.<br>
Anyway - Here's the Answers: <hr> <b>Question #1 (by Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr) 
Your music is surely the best tune that I've ever heard in '90s ! &gt;From the 
last two albums, you used only classical '70s prog instruments like mellotron, 
acoustic piano, flute, electric guitar without much effect, etc. I think your 
music's atmosphere would be quite different if you used some modern instruments. 
Is there any special reason for you to choose such a 'classical instrumets' 
? Or did you use those instruments somewhat intentionally to create those 'good 
old days' feel ?</b></p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14">Answer #1 <br>
We try to create a sound which is similar to the sound of an symphony orchestra. 
That's why we try to use a lot of acoustic instruments and try to avoid to much 
effect-processing. We also use old instruments as the mellotron because it feels 
alive. You can't use mellotron to simulate real strings or choirs, but you can 
use it to make the total sound more alive. The sound of a symphony orchestra 
is of course very much alive because each melody has a dedicated musician. But 
we never used old instruments to make it sound like a production from the '70s. 
</p>
<p><hr><b> Question #2 (by Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr) After hearing 
the new album 'Epilog', I noticed the music is quite different from 'Hybris'. 
Sometimes songs from 'Epilog' reminds me of modern classical music, or even 
some chamber rock tunes. I was really happy that you did not create 'Hybris 
II'. How do you think about the difference between the two albums ? </b></p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14">Answer #2 <br>
When we made Epilog none of us was listening to progressive rock anymore. So 
we think that we were making more music and less progressive rock this time. 
Hybris is (compared to Epilog) more based on prog cliches. </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #3 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr) Since we Korean 
fans could not see you play live, we're somewhat curious about the guitar playing 
shared by you(Jonas) and Tod. Who does play the 'lead tunes' generally ? Especially, 
who have done the cool solo in Jordrok ?</b></p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> Answer #3 
<br>
Jonas is playing the lead tunes (and plays the solo in Jordr?). Jonas has very 
often a sharper sound (from a Fender Strat or Les Paul) while Tord has got a 
more &quot;jazzy&quot; sound. Tord is playing most of the acoustic guitars. 
On Epilog he didn't play much electric guitar at all.</p>
<p><hr><b> Question #4 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr) The cover artwork 
of 'Epilog' is very interesting. The scene of a pond overlapped with human face, 
right ? Where did you get the picture of a pond ? Also I'd like to know the 
meaning of the cover, if exists.</b></p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14">Answer #4<br>
There is no deap meaning with the cover. It's just beautiful and fits the music 
(We hope). It's made by an old swedish artist (an 80-years-old lady, actually) 
called Rut Hillarp. </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #5 (Minsu Jang. cats@super5.hyundai.co.kr) I think your 
music is very reminiscent of those '70s big names like King Crimson and Genesis. 
What is your philosophy on songwriting ? Do you want to succeed to the grand 
tradition of King Crimson, Yes and Genesis without putting in newer '90s elements 
not that much ? Or do you want make quite different music from your '70s ancestors 
?</b></p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14">Answer #5<br>
We definitely want to create something new. We also try not to get to much influences 
by those groups you mentioned. We're not very interested in styles. </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #6 (Minsu Jang, cats@super5.hynudai.co.kr) We know that 
there are many great prog groups in Sweden. How do you think about 70's ancestor 
prog groups in Sweden ? What are your favourite Swedish artists ?</b></p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14">Answer #6<br>
They use to be quite good but unfortunately it's seldom that you hear something 
that's really new. About the favourite group... some in the band says &quot;Den 
Fule&quot; a swedish folk-jazz-band.</p>
<p><hr><b> Question #7 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr) This question 
may partially overlaps with the above one. We've heard that you're friends with 
members of Anekdoten. How do you think about Anekdoten ? and how about the yet 
another Scandinavian new group Landberk ? </b></p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14">Answer #7<br>
Yes, we're friends with Anekdoten and Landberk. Anekdoten are incredible live, 
but their music isn't as dynamic as their ancestors King Crimson. Landberk is...nice 
but more like pop. Those two groups are still much better than the average prog 
from USA.</p>
<p><hr><b> Question #8 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr) I've listened 
to the live tapes of Progfest. You played very well in the gigs, too ! By the 
way, what is your frank opinion about the other groups (Echolyn, Sebastian Hardie, 
Halloween, etc ) attended Progfest '94 together ? Also, how do you think about 
the currently active various prog sub-genres ? I mean British neo prog typified 
by IQ and Marillion , kinda RIO music by American band 5UU's and Japanese bands 
Tipographica, Il Berlione etc. and American 'accessible' prog exemplified by 
Kalaban, Animator, Echolyn or even Dream Theater. </b></p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14">Answer #8<br>
We're not interested in that kind of &quot;neo-prog&quot;. But some of the groups 
attended progfest were enjoyable and they were all very friendly.</p>
<p><hr><b> Question #9 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr) I'd like to 
ask you some non-music related questions. The pictures of you once appeared 
in the Korean prog rock magazine ArtRock (along with stellar praising review 
of 'Hybris'). The members of your band look very young. Would you please tell 
me the birth year of your members ? (My apologies for the wrong spelling of 
you and Johan's name, some of the characters are unavailable :-)) </b></p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14">Answer #9<br>
Tord Lindman : 68 <br>
Jonas Endeg?d : 74 <br>
Thomas Johnson : 74 <br>
Anna Holmgren : 69 <br>
Johan H?berg : 69 <br>
Mattias Olsson : 75 </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #11 (Incheol Shin, icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr) Though I saw 
your post on a.m.p. on the rumour about disbanding, I'm still curious about 
your future plan. Some guys said 'Epilog' might be a real epilog for the Anglagard 
fans, is that true ? Does the album title 'Epilog' have that kind of meaning 
? Is there any plan to rehearse a new album or world wide tour ? </b></p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14">Answer #11<br>
When we made Epilog we felt that this would be the last prog-rock album. The 
next one should be something different. That was one meaning of Epilog. Now 
it seems like we've disbanded (so, no more gigs). </p>
<p><hr><b> Question #12 (Minsu Jang, cats@super5.hyundai.co.kr Incheol Shin, 
icshin@chiak.kaist.ac.kr) Would you please say hello to your fans in Korea, 
especially at prog mailinglist YeBaDong ? And finally, How much cost do you 
expect for you to come here to play some gigs ? (I'm somewhat serious. Maybe 
I can arrange a promotion(just a thought) :-) </b></p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14">Answer #12<br>
We're very happy to have people who appreciates our music. Thank you! </p>
