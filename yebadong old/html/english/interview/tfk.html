<p>Roine Stolt is born in Sweden, became the lead guitarist in Kaipa, Sweden 
progressive rock band. In that time, he was just 17 years old. In Kaipa, he 
worked and made 2 albums. In 1979, he left Kaipa to form his own band, Fantasia 
and made 2 albums. </p>
<p>In the late of 80's, he started up publishing and recording label , Foxtrot 
Music. He became the leader of The Flower Kings, which is the best in the recent 
days IMHO. The Flower Kings made about 6 albums officially. He also take part 
in several project band like Par Lindh Project. He is the huge foot in progressive 
rock scene. Although he is very busy for managing, playing, rehearsals, and 
gigs, he answered interview. We gave him great appreciation. </p>
<p>He is a man of his word. Doesn't he look very kind? After the reply of some 
waiting, the interview mail was arrived. We can peep in his view of music, self-confidence. 
I'm sorry for my broken English.</p>

:1. I think TFK's all albums are really great in '90 prog scene.
:   But if I have to choice only one album, I will do &quot;Retropolis&quot; as
:   my desert island cd. Could you recommend which album have to be
:   listened first among TFK's albums (for new listeners) ?
&nbsp;
<span style="background-color:purple;"><font color="white">Roine Stolt</font></span>
&nbsp;
<font color="yellow">Well, I really don't know, maybe &quot;Stardust We Are&quot; .....there are so</font>
<font color="yellow">many different songs and styles, it showcases all that is  typical</font>
<font color="yellow">FlowerKings.</font>
<font color="yellow">It is both complex and easy to listen to.</font>
<font color="yellow">I know Retropolis is a favourite among lots of fans .</font>
<font color="yellow">that's good ....it started out as a leftovers album project...and ended up</font>
<font color="yellow">as a full production.</font>

:2. I've heard that TFK was getting into a new project with
:   members of Spock's Beard, Marillion and Dream theater.
:   I wonder what sound it has ? Must it be great?
&nbsp;
<span style="background-color:purple;"><font color="white">Roine Stolt</font></span>
&nbsp;
<font color="yellow">Yes, the group is named  &quot;Transatlantic&quot;, we had so much fun recording</font>
<font color="yellow">it in June and July  -99.</font>
<font color="yellow">It's me, Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater, Neal Morse of Spocks Beard and</font>
<font color="yellow">Pete Trewavas of Marillion.</font>
<font color="yellow">They are all so full of music.</font>
<font color="yellow">The album will be released in March 2000.</font>

:3. My feelings about your guitar sound is really extraordinary
:   (of course your voice,too ^^) from bluzzy sound in 'Pilgrims Inn' of
:   'TFK' album to spacy soaring thing in 'Compassion' of 'Stardust We Are'
:   album. IMHO, you seems firstly to concentrate on the composition and
:   try to fit your playing into that. So, end results always be good.
:   Many people resemble your guitar sounds to diverse genre guitarist,
:   Stewe Howe, Joe Satriani, Andy Latimer, Alan Holdsworth, Steve Vai....
:   Could you tell who most inspire your great sounds ?
&nbsp;
<span style="background-color:purple;"><font color="white">Roine Stolt</font></span>
&nbsp;
<font color="yellow">I like all the guitarist you've mentioned ....</font>
<font color="yellow">But many more inspiered me ... Pat Metheny , George Wadenius, Carlos</font>
<font color="yellow">Santana, Robin Trower,Frank Zappa,Bob Fripp, Peter Green, Steve Hackett,BB</font>
<font color="yellow">King, David Gilmour , David Lindley , George Harrison, Adrian Belew.,</font>
<font color="yellow">Yngvie Malmsteen, David Thorn , Jimi Hendrix  ....</font>
<font color="yellow">But also I listen to many Keyboardists... the phrasing is most important.</font>

:4. I am sorry now I'd like to know Original form of Mr. Doctor.
:   As I know the Flower king, Devill Doll, White Willow, etc,
:   played the Scandinavian Progressive Rock Festival in Gothenburg
:   on 30- 31th of Oct 1998. So, you may hobnob with Mr.Doctor.
:   How vice is he ?  he has really Doctor license ?
:   :-)  I am Mr. nurse.

<font color="yellow">Sorry ,we didn't play that festival .... I don't think we were ever</font>
<font color="yellow">supposed to .....who told ou  ??</font>
<font color="yellow">what's more I don't  think Devil Doll is that interesting ....it's to dark</font>
<font color="yellow">depressing music to fit my taste .</font>

:5. Let's share in your view. What is the best line up in the
:   world ? What is true sense of Progressive Rock ?
&nbsp;
<span style="background-color:purple;"><font color="white">Roine Stolt</font></span>
&nbsp;
<font color="yellow">You can never know what line up is good until you've tried it .....</font>
<font color="yellow">it's not only a question of good musicianship ....</font>
<font color="yellow">it's more a question of chemistry between members.</font>
<font color="yellow">Progressive rock is music that dare to try new and  uncommon ways .</font>
<font color="yellow">But also a label of the experimental rock of the late 60: ies and 70: ies .</font>

:6. What is your favourite prog artist in current prog scene ?
&nbsp;
네가 현재 가장 좋아하는 프록 아티스트는 누구니?
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<span style="background-color:purple;"><font color="white">Roine Stolt</font></span>
&nbsp;
<font color="yellow">I like King Crimson most, because they are ....progressive ..... it always</font>
<font color="yellow">sound frech.</font>
<font color="yellow">I like a lot of the Dream Theater  stuff and  a lot of the Spocks Beard</font>
<font color="yellow">stuff......</font>
<font color="yellow">Peter Gabriel is still fresh and  Yes is my all time favourites  ...their</font>
<font color="yellow">shows are still full of great music and  vital energy .</font>
&nbsp;
<font color="white">난 King Crimson을 제일 좋아해. 왜냐면 그들은 진보적이니까. 그리고 항상</font>
<font color="white">신선한 사운드를 보여줘.</font>
<font color="white">난 Dream Theater와 Spocks Beard와 같은 것들도 매우 좋아해.</font>
<font color="white">Peter Gabriel도 역시 신선하고, Yes는 나의 올타임 favorites이지.</font>
<font color="white">그들의 음악은 굉장한 음악과 화끈한 에너지로 가득차 있지</font>.

:7. Some guys would define your music as somewhere cross between
:   neo prog and symphonic in the '70s. Do you find it somewhat
:   uncomfortable if your music is regarded as neo ?
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<span style="background-color:purple;"><font color="white">Roine Stolt</font></span>
&nbsp;
<font color="yellow">I don't mind, it's just a label.</font>
<font color="yellow">however I find our music lightyears  !!!  apart from  neo -bands like Arena</font>
<font color="yellow">, Pendragon , IQ   as we're dealing with  far more complex rhythm</font>
<font color="yellow">structures and   harmonic textures ,</font>
<font color="yellow">It's up to anyone who listen  to our stuff to label as whatever ....I don't</font>
<font color="yellow">care .... it's just music .</font>

:8. Is there any plan to record songs in your mother tongue ?
:   Of course I'm not saying that I don't like your English vocal,
:   but I think it would be quite cool if you just throw in a
:   few tracks with Swedish vocal so that we can appreciate
:   more Nordic feel from your music.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<span style="background-color:purple;"><font color="white">Roine Stolt</font></span>
&nbsp;
<font color="yellow">I don't think so, as we have  90 % of our listers  outside of Sweden .</font>
<font color="yellow">And what's more  ...we have some  kind of message ...it won't be</font>
<font color="yellow">understandable in Swedish  .</font>

:10. I like your music very much. But the people who like progressive
:   rock music is much less than modern rock, techno, rap, etc.
:   I think that both of Kaipa, TFK are far from commercial gains. You
:   seem to ignore money. Have you ever been temptated by commercial
:   purpose ? And I'd like to know the reason why you love prog rock.
:   Is it silly question? *:-)
:   ( I'm also curious to know your opinion about current popular music
:   like modern rock, techno, rap, etc )

<font color="yellow">I like so many  kinds of music ,  I  even like pop music  like ABBA,</font>

<font color="yellow">I like Jazz,....Miles Davis, Wheater Report, Chic Corea, Keith Jarret, Tony</font>
<font color="yellow">Williams ....</font>
<font color="yellow">I 'm not that interested in Techno   ...it's to monotone for me ..... I</font>

:11. I hear some influence of 70's group like Genesis, Yes, and
:   King Crimson in TFK music. Do you feel nostalgia for 70's prog
:   like many old prog fans?
&nbsp;
