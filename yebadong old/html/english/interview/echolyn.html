<p>This is YBD interview with Echolyn. At this time, we connected directly to 
a band member, Chris Buzby of Echolyn. Echolyn is a really nice team as they 
are reviewed in Gibraltar. </p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> <b>In-Cheol 
: Would you introduce the current line-up of your band and a short history of 
Echolyn? </b></p>
<p>The current echolyn line-up consists of: 
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Christopher Buzby - keyboards, backing vocals 
    <li>Tom Hyatt - bass, midi pedals 
    <li>Brett Kull - guitars, lead and backing vocals 
    <li>Paul Ramsey - drums and percussion 
    <li>Ray Weston - lead and backing vocals 
</ul>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> A.1: Brett 
Kull, Paul Ramsey, Ray Weston and a different keyboard player were all in a 
cover/original band for 4 years called Narcissus. That band broke up in 1988. 
In the fall of 1989 Brett, Paul and our old bass player (Jesse Reyes) were jamming 
together. They auditioned keyboard players and found me (Chris Buzby). We called 
Ray and he re-joined and echolyn was formed. The only member change weve had 
is when Jesse Reyes (bass) quit for personal reasons in May of 1991. We were 
fortunate enough to acquire Tom Hyatt almost immediately, and we have been a 
strong unit ever since. </p>
<p><hr> <b><img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> In-Cheol 
: What is the origin of the band name 'Echolyn'? What is the meaning of it? 
And how is it pronounced? Eh-co-lin? or Eh-co-line?</b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> A.2: Brett actually came up with the name echolyn. 
It really doesn't mean anything at all- it was just a name we all liked. To 
us, the name echolyn represents our music and our lyrics. We pronounce it eh-co-lin. 
</p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> <b>In-Cheol 
: I think your album 'Suffocating the Bloom' sings about the naive mind in childhood 
which is being lost by dirty adulthood. Would you tell me the concept of the 
album?</b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> A.3: 
We were very frustrated during the writing and recording of 'Suffocating the 
Bloom'. People were really slagging us for the type of music we played, and 
no one really seemed to understand the fact that we were very honest about it. 
Lyrically Brett and Ray captured a certain theme based on the suffocated artist 
and youthful innocence in general. Musically we tried to capture those same 
feelings through many different styles using consonance, dissonance, melody, 
harmony, unique song arrangements, 2 and 3-part harmonies, acoustic and electric 
instrumentation and musical themes and variations that would interplay with 
the lyrics. </p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> <b>In-Cheol 
: The long-time song 'Suite for everyman' in Suffocating the Bloom is very great! 
Will you play another ling-time song in your new album? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> A.4: The Suite for the Everyman was a piece that we 
didnt set out to make long, it just kind of turned out that way. For us a musical 
thought or expression should take as much or as little time as possible to state 
itself. Length should have little to with the quality of a piece of music. On 
As the World, instead of writing a long piece with many sections we decided 
to write a longer piece that tied itself together lyrically, but musically each 
piece stands on its own as a complete piece of music. The piece on As the World 
is called LETTERS. Lyrically it deals with ones progression through life as 
a naive child to a dying elderly person. It turned out really well, and were 
very happy with it. Cant wait for you to hear it! </p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> <b>In-Cheol 
: I think that you are influenced by Yes and Kansas, especially by Gentle Giant 
in my personal opinion when I hear 'As the World' or 'A Little Nonsense'. What 
bands influenced you? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> 
A.5: It would be absolutely impossible to name one main influence for this band 
because each member listens to such a diverse amount of music. Styles range 
from jazz, classical (traditional and 20th century), rock, heavy metal, pop, 
folk, fusion, blues, new age, etc., etc., etc. Some members did indeed grow 
up listening to bands like early Genesis, Yes, Gentle Giant and Kansas. We feel 
that what we are doing musically has so much more to offer than what most bands 
today are doing musically. We are simply trying to push the limits of what music 
has to offer while creating something fresh and new each time. Hopefully we 
will have success at what we love to do. A few personal musical favorites of 
each band member are: 
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Ray Weston- Thin Lizzy; Pantera; Corrosion of Conformity. 
    <li>Tom Hyatt- John Paul Jones; Jaco Pastorius; Joni Mitchell.
    <li>Paul Ramsey- Dennis Chambers; Gary Husband; Buddy Rich. 
    <li>Brett Kull- Anthony Phillips; Pat Metheny; The Beatles. 
    <li>Chris Buzby- Igor Stravinsky; Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays; Seal.
</ul>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> <b>In-Cheol 
: It is very impressive of your chorus part which seems to be recorded multiply 
when I listen to your music. How do you record your songs? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> A.6: On Suffocating the Bloom we actually doubled all 
the lead and backing vocals which gave the album a natural chorused effect on 
all the vocal parts. On this album there is a similar doubling and tripling 
on all the backing vocals, but all the leads are single (aside from effects 
that may have been added during the mixing process). In terms of harmony there 
is a whole lot of 2-part and especially 3-part harmony on As the World. Again, 
we wanted to take another step forward in pushing the limits of standard rock 
music as we know it today.</p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> <b>In-Cheol 
: What do you think about the new progressive teams of the States, such as Animator, 
Kalaban, and Magellan, or Deux Ex Machina, Xaal of Europe? I think you are very 
different from the other 'so-called' neo-prog bands because your music is unique 
and innovative which is not just an imitation of '70s music.</b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> A.7: We honestly have yet to hear anything else current 
that we really respect or like coming from any American or European bands playing 
this type of progressive music. Some of the guys in the band do like a band 
named Discipline from the state of Michigan, USA, and I personally think the 
members of Dream Theater are great players, but I dont really like their compositional 
style or vocals. In a sense we really seem to think at times that we are the 
only band really trying to do something new, fresh and different- many of the 
bands you name (Kalaban; Animator; Magellan) borrow their styles very blatantly 
from bands who have already established themselves (i.e. Marillion, Yes, ELP, 
etc.). </p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> <b>In-Cheol 
: I was really astonished at your play in live bootleg!! How could you play 
such a complex stuff so nice?</b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14"
 height="14"> A.8: We pride ourselves in being able to play everything we write 
at a live show. If we ever put something on an album that we dont want to play 
live we still have a reason for that piece of music existing where it does on 
the album. Even all the string and woodwind arrangements I do are pulled off 
live because I write the original parts in a band sense on my synthesizers. 
When we do go into the recording studio I use real instrumentalists to do all 
the parts because nothing comes close to the real thing in classical music- 
not even great samplers; although they do serve an important purpose for live 
performance. </p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> <b>In-Cheol 
: Your early recordings are so hard to get. Anyway, I congratulate your contract 
with Sony. Is there any plan to reissue your early stuffs in Sony?</b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> A.9: SONY Corp./Epic did buy our master tapes to the 
three previous releases (echolyn; Suffocating the Bloom; ...and every blossom) 
and they will probably be releasing them in the future. Unfortunately we have 
no control over the timing of that decision, as we will have to spend most of 
our current time promoting this new album.</p>
<p><hr> <img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> <b>In-Cheol 
: Now I am asking you questions instead of Korean fans, especially YeBaDong 
fans. Would you send a greeting to YeBaDong friends?</b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> A.10: Hello to all the fans of progressive music in 
YeBaDong! echolyn wishes you all a wonderful 1995, and we hope to see you all 
soon at a live show in your country. As the World is coming- March 7th is the 
USA release! </p>
<p><hr> </p>
<pre>    I hope I was able to answer all your questions Incheol. We
are truly excited that there are so many people in Korea, and
all around the world, who listen to our music and like what we
are doing. We hope to make it to Europe, Japan and Korea on a
tour in the not-too-distant future. If we are coming you will
be one of the first to know. If there is anything more we can
do for you please let us know.
