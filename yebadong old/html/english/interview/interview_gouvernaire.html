             size="2">Sylvain Gouvernaire was the leader (guitar, keyboard) 
            of Arrakeen, France neo-progressive rock band. In the recent days, 
            he made IRIS, his own project band. This band was introduced at 
            Artrock magazine. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">He has dragged the field 
            of neo-progressive rock with his efforts. He shows his competence 
            although reputation is smaller than that of Roine Stolt. He can 
            be compared to French Lee Changsik. He answered very kindly to my 
            poor question. Not simple answer, showed his confidence.</font></p>

                        1. Some Korean proggers remember you as Arrakeen's leader 
                        than solo<br> artist(carreer) so far. Your powerful 
                        and melodic guitar sounds and Maiko's dynamic and delicate<br> 
                        voice made Arrakeen so specilal among the tons of the 
                        other neo-bands..<br> If you don't mind, could you say 
                        why is Arrakeen broken up and what is Maiko doing now 
                        ?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><br> </font></p>

                        Arrakeen split up for different reasons, one of it was 
                        Maiko getting difficult to work with because of ego 
                        problems, but the main reason is because some members 
                        of the band were disappointed of the lack of response 
                        from the music business in France, and preferred to 
                        stop.&nbsp;<br> Maiko and Eric Bonnardel( Keyboards) 
                        feared they would not manage to make a living out of 
                        Arrakeen after all, and decided to give up making music. 
                        When it happened I was rather upset and decided to live 
                        England for a while. : I was myself quite pissed off 
                        with the music business in<br> France. Maiko is now 
                        working as a specialised nurse in Psychology. As far 
                        as I know, she doesn't</font><font face="Arial" size="2">

                        &quot;Mosaic&quot;.Especially I like all-star project 
                        album CASINO(s/t).<br> I think this album is masterpiece 
                        in early 90 neo-prog scene. Yeap...It is regretful that 
                        we can't hear no more Geoff Mann's voice. I guess if 
                        Geoff Mann is alive, he seems to be good rival with 
                        Fish in<br> current prog scene. In CASINO, especially 
                        middle and ending part of last track 'Beyond that<br> 
                        door' have been killed me whenever listen..<br> Did 
                        you solo playing this track.? right ?<br> Could you 
                        tell me how can you make great melody like this? also, 
                        where do your main influences came from ? (musician, 
                        group, anything)</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><br>

                        <p align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><br> 
                        That's right, it is me playing there.....Thank you for 
                        this compliment !<br> <br> <br> It is difficult for 
                        me to answer that question because the truth is:<br> 
                        it's all about inspiration: Whether a piece of music 
                        inspires me or not and whether I feel inspired at the 
                        moment I play that piece of music. I suppose there is 
                        also a bit of &quot;know how&quot; and experience. But, 
                        truly, the main thing is inspiration. And who knows 
                        where it comes from ?<br> <br> As for my influences, 
                        well I started with the piano. I played classical piano 
                        for a long time from when I was a child; So I've got 
                        classical influences with composers such as Beethoven, 
                        Mozart, Schubert, Debussy, Ravel, Satie etc. In Rock 
                        music I 've been influenced by various bands or artists 
                        from The Beatles to Genesis, from Pink Floyd to The 
                        Police, Peter Gabriel, early Dire Straits.<br> As for 
                        pure lead guitar playing I would say David Gilmour, 
                        Eric Clapton, Ian Crighton (of Saga), some hard rock 
                        players such as Van Halen..I am probably forgetting 
                        some people here..</font></p>

                        <br> I must admit I am not very good for definitions; 
                        especially when it comes to my own music...However I 
                        like the word 'neo' applied to it, I find it flattering....I 
                        am not trying to stick to a given style of music I am 
                        only trying to express myself, to communicate. I feel 
                        that music is good when it's inspired (which is rare) 
                        and well done (ditto), when it expresses something or 
                        communicates something that somehow makes you feel in 
                        tune with all things. And I believe you can find great 
                        works of music under many different styles or aspects.<br> 
                        <br> Personally, I like all kind of stuff, I like 'new' 
                        stuff and I like 'old' stuff. I feel it doesn't necessarily 
                        matters if it 'sounds' new: I learned to be cautious 
                        about the way music is marketed: sometimes some bright 
                        and apparently expensive sound or packaging (sleeve, 
                        etc.) can hide a lack<br> of inspiration or honesty 
                        But, of course, that'S only Rock'n Roll..<br> </font></p>

                        featuring Pete and Ian is really fantastic..<br> Ian 
                        and Pete's rythm part seems to be more aggressive and 
                        powerful than Marillion's.<br> Do you familiar with 
                        marillion members ? If you so, I envy wth you..^^<br> 
                        Have you any plan to work with marillion's members in 
                        near future ?<br> I wanna listen your twin solo playing

                        to each other on the phone from time to time or meet 
                        when they are touring.&nbsp; Pete was interested in 
                        playing on the next IRIS album but that was before his 
                        accident. So I don't know if I will work again with 
                        any of them in the future. It's not planned for the

                        explain what is this animal(right?) or What does this

                        and is very mysterious...It has been created by Regis 
                        Loisel (a comic artist).<br> It was indeed ARRAKEEN's 
                        mascot. On the Iris sleeve It's an allegoric reference

                        You're recoding for IRIS 2nd album and playing for some 
                        gigs..<br> Could you tell me current status of your 
                        next album ?<br> (Concept, theme, member, release date, 
                        anything is ok)&nbsp; Also, I am very curious about 
                        your voice.. ^^ Do you have any plan to include your 
                        voice in next projet ?<br> or How about inviting guest 
                        vocal..like F I S H ? or rejoining MAIKO..?<br> Frankly 
                        to speak, You don't need any voice because your melody 
                        is very abundant. </font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><br> 
                        Thank you for this remark. The thing is: I also have 
                        written some vocal material and I would love<br> to 
                        see it released on the next IRIS album. So this album 
                        will be a mixture between some vocals and some new instrumental 
                        pieces. As for the voice I quite enjoy singing my own 
                        songs, and it will be a new and exiting challenge for 
                        me to record that on an album.<br> I haven't thought 
                        yet of any guest singers but that is always a possibility 
                        if I feel a song needs it....<br> All of the material 
                        is already written and demoed. I had to postpone the 
                        recording a few times because I am also working as a 
                        producer on a different project.<br> So hopefully the 
                        next IRIS album will be recorded and released sometimes 
                        in 2000. </font></p>
