<h1>YBD Interview with <i>Magellan</i></h1>
<p><hr><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> Proceeded 
by Bret Linford of PROGnosis <hr> </p>
<p><img src="../../icon/whitebal.gif" width="14" height="14"> This YBD interview 
with Magellan proceeded by Bret Linford of PROGnosis instead of us. Special 
thanks to him. <hr> <img src="../../icon/whitebal.gif" width="14" height="14"> 
This interview was conducted in December 1994 via phone to Magellan's studio 
in Vacaville, California. Wayne and Trent Gardner were hard at work on their 
third Magna Carta album. while Trent was busy with a keyboard part Wayne was 
kind enough to take a break to answer our questions... </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q1. We know that Magna Carta's first release is Magellan's &quot;Hour 
of Restoration.&quot; The second is shadow gallery's self-titled debut album 
and the last one is &quot;Impending Ascension&quot; by Magellan. Are there any 
other albums released by Magna Carta? And also, we're very curious to know about 
the Magna Carta label and Mike Varney. Please give us a short history of Magna 
Carta. </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> Wayne 
Gardner: So far, that's it. Cairo comes out in late January 1995. I don't know 
if ours will be out in 'early '95' but it will definitely be out in '95. It 
depends how fast we can jam through this. We want to take our time. There are 
a few other possible releases, but those our still confidential but will be 
very exciting. </p>
<p>It was a joint idea between Mike Varney and Peter Morticelli. The saw the 
niche that prog rock had. It had its own fans and fanzines but maybe wasn't 
taken care of all that well by any American-based label especially the heavier 
variety of prog. SI music and Musea has been around for awhile but they don't 
lean towards the heavier side. They saw the opportunity and they went for it. 
Pete handles the day-to-day sort of business and Mike is mostly the A and R 
guy who handles the talent. </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q2. Would you please tell us about the exact release date and title, 
if possible, of your third album? Is there any specific idea or concept in Magellan's 
upcoming album? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> 
WG: I wish I knew when it was coming out, as far as the exact date. I know it 
will be out in '95 and we're trying to get it out as soon as possible. Right 
now we still have a lot of work ahead of us so I can't pinpoint the exact date 
for release. It's called &quot;Test Of Wills&quot; and if there's any theme 
behind it is about struggling against the odds, that sort of thing. Remember 
how Rush had &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;? We didn't have that in mind but 
it's a similar kind of concept. Our's is better and will sound heavier! (laughs) 
I hesitate to call it a thematic thing or a concept album especially when we 
get around to releasing all the track names. We have actually written them out 
but it's not 100% solid. </p>
<p>There's a possibility that we'll have a bonus track for Japan only or U.S. 
only, we haven't decided. We have one song that's about 8 minutes long and it's 
kind of in a different style so were not sure what to do with it yet. Maybe 
we can sneak it on the album or something. </p>
<p><img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> Bret Linford: 
Is it because your not sure this song fits with the rest of the music or what?</p>
<p><img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> WG: It's clearly 
a different style. It's more of a Marillion/Genesis thing. Most of the stuff(for 
the new album) is heavier than that and is probably heavier than the first two 
albums. Were not sure if it will fit. We like to write albums in context to 
make sure it blends properly. We don't want it sticking out like a sore thumb. 
That track sort of sticks out. </p>
<p><img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> BL: Where would 
you put this song as to where Magellan want to go? Is it just an anomaly or 
is it a conscious move towards something? </p>
<p><img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> WG: Well, we purposely 
wrote it in a different style just to do it. It came together so fast and we 
started liking it. It came together faster than almost anything we've ever done 
before. But then we started to record it and we weren't sure 'cause we had so 
many others to record that we had to shelve it for awhile. It was an anomaly 
for sure 'cause usually everything we write, we use. It's not like us to write 
a song and not use it, so it's definitely one-of-a-kind. </p>
<p><img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> BL: Do you think 
the reason it came together so quick was because you wanted to do something 
different and maybe you weren't pressured by the fact that you wanted it to 
sound like Magellan?</p>
<p><img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> WG: That's it exactly! 
We knew we wanted to try something different. So we just went for it with the 
attitude that whatever happens, happens. And it worked out and it didn't sound 
too bad! </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q3. We've heard that your first album got much attention in Japan. 
We'd like to know how many copies were sold in Japan. And how 'bout the second 
album? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> WG: 
I suppose it got some attention. I don't exactly how much, but we got a lot 
of good press off it. I can't read Japanese but I can read the numbers, as far 
as rating go. I don't know exactly how much we've sold there but it's definitely 
in the low five figures. We didn't sell enough to retire or anything!(laughs) 
The label was very pleased with how we've done considering we're unknown and 
haven't toured, etc. </p>
<p>We're hoping that the third album will do a lot better because the first 
two albums had a lot of long songs. Radio is a real key. Most of our stuff you 
just couldn't air. Our short songs were too short to even play! &quot;The Winner&quot; 
was that way. It was actually part of something longer but was condensed into 
about a two minute song. So, look forward to the third one to have some shorter 
stuff. There will still be long songs 'cause we still love to do that. With 
the new album we've put the emphasis on good songwriting but we need to explore 
the shorter areas but at the same time not wimp out! (laughs) That's why I'm 
really excited about these new tunes. They rock! (laughs) </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q4. Have you played any live gigs? We suppose there are many of you 
fans in Korea and Japan. Do you have any plans to tour the Far-East in the near 
future? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> WG: 
We have to see how well the album does. I'm sure if it does well that record 
company will get us out there and say, &quot;You guys just gotta tour!&quot; 
It will be expensive to get us out there. We may have to get one or two drummers, 
possibly. It's pretty expensive to go over to Japan with the exchange rate being 
what it is. If it sells well there's a good chance. That's the reason we haven't 
gone over with the first two albums. It's prohibitively expensive. </p>
<p>We actually spent a lot of time on &quot;Impending Ascension&quot; and by 
the time it was finished we needed a break. But then it was time to start on 
the third one. As it is now were cranking an album out once every two years 
but if we toured in addition to that we'd be long-forgotten by everybody! </p>
<p>We have too may ideas now. We're just so anxious to get recording and doing 
these new tunes. I really think we'll get the fourth album out noticeably sooner 
than the first three. Now that we have our own recording equipment. We can make 
the recordings better and faster. Instead of traveling long distances back and 
forth to a studio which we've always done it the past, staying up long nights, 
we can now do it much more comfortably. It's better for the music 'cause we 
feel more creative. There's now pressure to get out of the studio when our time 
is up. Those days are gone! </p>
<p>We've spent more time on this one song than we've spent on any three of our 
older songs. And were not even done with it yet! In fact, we're not even done 
tracking it and then there's the mix on top of that. And that's just for a five 
minute song. So, we're spending much more time. That's the only reason we haven't 
cranked them out every week or something. We're able to relax, able to do four, 
five, or six hours of recording a day. We've been at this one song for two weeks. 
And we still have a lot of work to do! But, it's gonna rule when it's done! 
(laughs) It's gonna be what we want. </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q5. You quoted Winston Churchill's words on your first album and 
Shakespeare's famous words on your second. Is there any specific reason for 
you to choose these historic characters? Are you also planning to quote other 
famous people's words on you upcoming album? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> WG: Yes, we did quote these men. We had the Churchill 
quote and we had this song about the Falkland Islands War and even though Churchill 
was obviously not involved it sounded cool. It sounded almost generic enough 
that it fit in with the concept. As regards Shakespeare, the studio we were 
recording at used that quote as part of an advertisement. It just sounded so 
cool, it sounded so good we just had to put it in a song someplace. So, we brought 
that in to &quot;Under The Wire.&quot; </p>
<p>As far as the next album, we don't want to get pigeon-holed here. We might, 
we might not...how's that for an answer?! A definite 'maybe.'(laughs) </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q6. Do you have any plans to recruit a drummer? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> WG: As far as the album, I still don't know. We've 
written about four or five tunes, but haven't done the final recording on any 
of them. It's possible that we might recruit Doane Perry again, it all depends 
whether he or someone else can fit it into their schedule. These guys are so 
busy! Tull is supposed to be recording their new album real soon. So, we'll 
have to play that one by ear. If we can snag a good drummer that would be great 
but we'll just have to see. We do have new drum equipment. It sounds a lot better 
than the old stuff.</p>
<p><hr> <b>Q7. The picture of your band once appeared in the Korean Rock magazine 
Hot Music. You look somewhat wiser than other proggers and metal-proggers of 
the '90s. Would you please be kind enough to tell us your birth dates? </b><hr> 
<img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> WG: Well, I appreciate 
the term 'wiser' 'cause there's certainly a lot of other terms that could be 
used! (laughs) I'm only 29 myself. I was born in 1965. Trent was born in 1962 
so he's 32 and Hal, I think, is a year older than Trent so he's 33. So we're 
really not 'that' old! I mean you got guys in Camel and Yes about ready to get 
their pensions and Social Security checks!</p>
<p><img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> BL: That's like 
the guys in Dream Theater are only about 26 or 27 so you're not that much older 
than them...</p>
<p><img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> WG: Well, you know, 
they have more hair so they just 'seem' younger!</p>
<p><hr> <b>Q8. We'd like to know how popular prog music is there in the States. 
We often regard Magellan as prog-metal along with Shadow Gallery and Dream Theater. 
Of course, Magellan's sound is much more prog-ish than Dream Theater and Fates 
Warning). To be more specific, how popular is prog-metal there in Western countries 
including the U.S.? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> 
WG: I know that Dream Theater has done well. I guess their last one, &quot;Images 
And Words,&quot; went gold. So, that tells you something when a band like that 
can come out of the blue and do so well. They play them quite a bit on MTV. 
You know, every time Rush come out they do well. The same with Tull, Floyd, 
Genesis, and others. I thing prog-metal is doing fine. The only thing they all 
have in common is major label support, which is critical. I think it still has 
life. Before people get tired of 'prog metal' there needs to come along another 
group with more 'hooks' or something. </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q9. In the Korean copy of Magellan's &quot;Hour of Restoration&quot; 
liner notes, it is written that you didn't employ a drum machine when recording 
and inside the booklet of &quot;Impending Ascension&quot; it was said that you 
use MIDI drum triggers to record the drum parts. We Korean Magellan fans were 
very puzzled about it. Is there any difference between the drum machine and 
MIDI drum triggers? Or did you really play drums with the stick in your hand 
when recording your first album (many Korean Magellan fans believe this to be 
so)? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> WG: 
Well, I'd like to be able to say it's so, but honestly, it isn't. It was all 
drum machines on the first album, completely. It was actually the same on the 
second album with the exception of &quot;Waterfront Weirdo's&quot; which had 
Doane Perry perform the whole thing. He had his whole drum kit set up with MIDI. 
We took all the MIDI information and inserted our own sounds. We picked all 
the sounds but he did all the playing. I thought it worked out pretty well. 
It has a lot of potential to sound even better. The third one? It'll probably 
work out the same way except that we have some new gear. </p>
<p>I have a whole new guitar rig, thanks to Mike Varney. My amp literally fried. 
It roasted! So Mike let me pick out one of his amps. I ended up borrowing the 
amp and two guitars! So, I have a whole new guitar sound. I think it's killer! 
I'm much happier with this sound than I was previously. </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q10. The spaceship that appeared on the sleeve of &quot;Hour of Restoration&quot; 
looks very cool and it reminded us of Yes' &quot;Fragile&quot; of near a score 
ago and Pallas' &quot;Sentinel&quot; of 10 years ago. So I often consider those 
three albums as the prog albums of the decade with a cool ship on their cover. 
Do you also like the other two albums? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> WG: Actually, I do! &quot;The Sentinel&quot; was one 
of these albums I discovered, I thought. I saw it at the record store one day 
and thought it might be cool. I thought the artwork was really cool so I bought 
it and really like it. I've been a fan of theirs since. Of course I like &quot;Fragile.&quot; 
</p>
<p>It was not done intentionally, that's for sure, regarding the ship, to copy 
the other albums. The concept for the first album cover was not really what 
we asked for! (laughs) Pete and Trent had extensive talks with the artist and 
it came right down to the deadline and we went down to see the art, and it looked 
real cool but it wasn't what we'd asked for, but we liked it! </p>
<p>The second cover, I don't really care for. I hope the artist can't read Korean 
'cause I didn't really care for it! (laughs) For the next one, we'd like to 
go in a whole new direction as far as artwork goes. Expect it to be very, very 
different. It won't look like the first two at all. We might do a logo change. 
We figure 'what the heck, you know?'</p>
<p><hr> <b>Q11. We've often heard that you keep very close ties with your predecessors 
such as bands like Jethro Tull, Yes, and Genesis. Do you have any special relationships 
with the members of '70's prog bands? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> WG: The only one I can say to that is Jethro Tull. 
Doane and Ian, to be specific. I wish I could say I knew the guys in Yes, to 
say I was hanging out with them and stuff but they just won't return our calls! 
(laughs) </p>
<p>The guys from Tull are incredibly busy. Ian has his salmon farm. He has a 
huge 'Tull' business. Plus his family, too. I'm surprised that the guys has 
given us the time of day, but he has. So, we feel real lucky there. Ian's tentatively 
scheduled to play on our album, at least on one track, if he can get the time. 
If he can squeeze in some hours to do it, he'll do it. We really hope so. We 
hope to just send him a song on ADAT (the digital format Magellan and Cairo 
use to record) and it'd be real easy. </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q12. Would you please briefly define your music? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> WG: Um...heavy prog, I guess. In some ways I'm leaning 
against calling it 'progressive' not because it isn't. We're obviously not in 
a state of denial. I wasn't even aware of the term 'progressive' until the late 
1980's or something. I was listening to Rush and Yes and all that and had no 
idea it was called progressive rock. Once in awhile I'd heard of 'art-rock' 
or something-I just thought it was 'music', you know? I'd describe our stuff 
as energetic. It' s not boring. I think we have, at least we try of r it anyway, 
original chord progressions. We try to be unpredictable. We're always deadly 
afraid of cliches. We try to avoid them if at all possible. 'Non-cliched heavy-rock'-how 
about that?! (laughs) </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q13. On the liner notes of your first album Ian Anderson of Jethro 
Tull fame was credited. We'd like to know what kind of suggestions and comments 
Ian gave you when your were recording your first album. Did Ian also help you 
with &quot;Impending Ascension&quot;? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> WG: Ian heard a copy of our demo tape. The first three 
songs were &quot;The Winner&quot;, &quot;Friends of America&quot;, and &quot;Union 
Jack&quot;. We sent it to him. He wrote us back and said he thought the music 
was very mature. He really liked it a lot. He suggested a name change (from 
&quot;Streamline&quot; as they were then known).I had glasses on in the photo 
we sent him. He said 'I betcha that guy in the glasses could come up with a 
good name'! Well, that was me and when the time came around for us to sign the 
contract with Magna Carta we finally came across Magellan. I was kind of thinking 
about it when he mentioned it, that &quot;Streamline&quot; kind of sounds like 
a bus! Our music was changing a lot at the time and it seemed like a good time. 
</p>
<p>Trent and I actually started writing music in the late 70's. It was progressive 
but not as heavy. Then the music started getting heavier and a little more compact. 
I just thought it was going in a new direction. Once you start putting out albums 
and all that and talking to people about it you really start to realize where 
you're coming from. We needed a concept. Where were we coming from? We really 
didn't used to think about that. We'd been writing songs for year. We played 
live occasionally, that kind of stuff. That's when we decided to get a new name 
due to Ian's suggestion and solidified the concept of Magellan. </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q14. To Trent: Which would you like to be called, a singing keyboard 
player or a keyboard-playing singer? Who are your favorite keyboardist and vocalist 
of all-time? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> 
Trent Gardner: I'd rather be known as a trombone player who's trying to sing 
and play keyboards. That's probably the instrument I'm most proficient on. My 
favorite keyboardist is Eddie Jobson. </p>
<p>WG: &quot;The Green Album&quot; by Zinc is one of our all-time favorites 
and a must-hear for any prog fan. </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q15. To Wayne: who is your favorite guitarist of all-time and which 
brand of guitar do you usually use? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> WG: It started off, hands down it was Alex Lifeson 
of Rush. For years that what I wanted to sound like. It's been changing over 
the years somewhat. I really don't have a favorite right now. I really like 
Steve Vai. I love John Petrucci. If anybody should be listened to, that's the 
guy! That guy rips! I probably listen to him more than anybody else right now. 
</p>
<p>For the longest time I used Carvin. To be honest, I'm kind of tired of it, 
I think. I think I need a change. And so my amp blew up. I thought, &quot;Ah, 
a perfect time to change.&quot; So, now I'm using Kramer, which I think is out-of-business 
now. I'm using a Kramer 'Sustainer', I think it's called. It has a like a built-in 
'E-bow.' You just flick a switch and all your gain notes are sustained instantly. 
It's killer! I've never used a tremolo before but this one has a Floyd Rose 
on it so I'll be making use of it. </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q16. Who is your all-time favorite band or artist? </b><hr> <img src="../../icon/redball.gif"
 width="14" height="14"> WG: It has to be a band with great tunes, songwriting. 
So, it's got to be Jethro Tull. Oh, man, like &quot;Songs from the Wood,&quot; 
&quot;Heavy Horses,&quot; 'Orion' and stuff. &quot;Aqualung&quot; - the list 
goes on... &quot;Broadsword and the Beast.&quot; All these albums have such 
killer songs, melodies, great hooks. Their approach-toungue-in-cheek sometimes, 
it's great! That's my all-time favorite. </p>
<p><hr> <b>Q17. Thanks a million for your kind answers! Would you please say 
hello to the Korean fans and especially the progheads at YeBaDong? </b><hr> 
</p>
<p><img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> WG: Hello! It's 
great to hear the YeBaDong exists! How many members are there? It's great that 
a group of people have gotten together to share a common interest in music. 
I think that's a good idea. </p>
<p>All's I can tell all of you is that our third album is gonna rule! We don't 
want to stay static and to sound like the first one or the second. This one 
we want to eliminate the bad stuff-our weaknesses. We're addressing those weaknesses, 
I think. We're just giving it more of everything, ya know? It's gonna look better, 
it's gonna sound better...it's just gonna rock! It's gonna be killer!(laughs) 
It'll be worth the wait. </p>
<p><img src="../../icon/blueball.gif" width="14" height="14"> BL: It sound like 
Magellan fans in Korea and around the world have a lot to look forward to... 
</p>
<p><img src="../../icon/redball.gif" width="14" height="14"> WG: I wish we had 
all the tunes recorded and stuff so it was just a matter of getting it out there. 
But, we have 5 written and sections of others but there not arranged yet. We 
needed more short tunes. Usually if a band says that it's like (in a mocking 
tone), &quot;Uh oh, you know what that means-they're selling out!&quot; But 
we have the benefit of experience. You know how when &quot;Namzamo&quot; by 
IQ came out? They were purposely writing these pop tunes. But that's not gonna 
happen with us. There aren't any pop songs on here! (laughs) They may be short 
but it's still definitely Magellan. It's still intense. We're not falling into 
a typical song structure, though. At the same time they need to be good. </p>
