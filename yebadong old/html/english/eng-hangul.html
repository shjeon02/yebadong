<h2> Hangul Troubles in E-Mail </h2>

<hr>

<li>
   For the present, the most serious problem is the HANGUL problem.
   I think some of you got broken korean mails. <p>

<li>
  I asked to some wizards to fix hangul problem and I think you can fix
  that problem. Please consider below.<p>

1. First method is to use hmail(hangul mail). But i think this method
  is time consuming and may bother you. <p>

2. Second method is to use file converter such as "hcode". 
  First get "hcode" or "ks2ios/ios2ks" utilities in ftp site, then install
  them to /usr/local/bin.
  In case of "hcode", you should subscribe the following contents on
  ~/.mailrc file.<p>
<ul>
  	set PAGER = "/usr/local/bin/hcode -ik | /usr/local/bin/more "
</ul>
  This command is for unbroken hangul file when you see the mailed file which is 
  
  sent in ISO code.<p>

  If you save the mailed file, the saved file is stiil in ISO code. So,
  you must convert that file to KS code by using "hcode" or so.<p>

3. If you are using "elm", select 'o' in menu, then set as follows.<p>
<ul>
  	D)isplay mail using  : /usr/loca/bin/hcode -ik | /usr/local/bin/more<p>
  	....<p>
  	P)rint mail using    : /usr/local/bin/hcode -ik >> save.file<p>
</ul>
  If you set as above, elm saves the mailed file in "save.file" in sequence,
  you don't need to convert the file to KS code.<p>

<li>
If you cannot fix the problem even if you tried, then mail to me(shjeon@
  cclab.kaist.ac.kr). I will ask again. Thank you.<p>
